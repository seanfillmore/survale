-- PURGE ALL TEST DATA
-- =====================================================
-- This script deletes ALL data from the database
-- Based on the actual Survale database schema
-- Use with EXTREME CAUTION - this is irreversible!
-- =====================================================
-- Recommended usage:
-- 1. Backup your database first (if needed)
-- 2. Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- 3. Verify data is deleted with the verification queries at the end
