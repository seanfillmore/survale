# Build Fixes Applied ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JoinOperationView.swift Missing
**Error:** `Build input file cannot be found`

**Fix:** File was deleted but still referenced in Xcode project.

**Action Required by User:**
- In Xcode, find `JoinOperationView.swift` in Project Navigator (will be red)
- Right-click → Delete → "Remove Reference"
- Clean (Cmd+Shift+K) and Build (Cmd+B)

### 2. joinCode References in SupabaseAuthService
**Error:** `Value of type 'Operation' has no member 'joinCode'`

**Fix:** ✅ Removed old unused functions from `DatabaseService`:
- `createOperation()` - replaced by RPC service
- `fetchOperations()` - replaced by RPC service  
- `joinOperation()` - no longer needed (join codes removed)

All operation CRUD now uses `SupabaseRPCService` which doesn't use join codes.

---

## Current Build Status

### Code Status
✅ No linter errors
✅ All joinCode references removed from Swift code
✅ Only documentation files mention joinCode (for history)

### Build Steps
1. **Remove Xcode reference** (manual step - see above)
2. **Clean:** Cmd+Shift+K
3. **Build:** Cmd+B
4. **Run:** Cmd+R

## What's Ready to Test

Once Xcode reference is removed and app builds:

### Operations List
- Shows all active operations
- Displays membership badges
- Request to join button works

### Console Output Expected
```
📥 Loading all active operations...
🔄 Loaded X active operations from database
  ✅ Operation Name - Member: Yes/No
✅ Loaded X active operations
   👤 You are in: [Operation Name] (if member of any)
   • Operation 1 - ✅ Member
   • Operation 2 - ⭕️ Not member
```

---

## Files Modified (Final)

### Deleted
- ❌ `Views/JoinOperationView.swift`

### Cleaned Up
- ✅ `Services/SupabaseAuthService.swift` - Removed old DB functions

### Previously Modified (Still Good)
- ✅ `Operation.swift` - No joinCode
- ✅ `OperationStore.swift` - Tracks membership
- ✅ `SupabaseRPCService.swift` - New RPC functions
- ✅ `OperationsView.swift` - New UI with badges

---

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Xcode reference** (manual - see top)
2. **Run SQL:** `Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql` in Supabase
3. **Test the app!**

If build succeeds and testing goes well, we can continue with:
- Team member selection (step 4)
- One-operation constraint
- Show operation name in Map/Chat

**Status:** Code is clean ✅ | Just need to remove Xcode reference | Then ready to test! 🎉
