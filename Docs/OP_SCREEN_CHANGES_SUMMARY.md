# Operation Screen Changes - Feature Summary

## Branch: `feature/op-screen-changes`

This branch contains significant UX improvements to the Operations screen and operation management workflows.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Direct Operation Details Display**
**Problem:** Users had to tap into active operations to see details  
**Solution:** Active operation details now display immediately on the Operations screen

**Benefits:**
- ✅ One less tap to see operation info
- ✅ Faster access to targets and staging areas
- ✅ Cleaner, more intuitive UX

---

### 2. **Transfer Operation** (Case Agent)
**Feature:** Case agents can transfer leadership to another team member

**Workflow:**
1. Case agent opens their active operation
2. Taps "Transfer Operation" (orange button)
3. Selects new case agent from team member list
4. Confirms transfer
5. System message notifies all members

**Database:**
- SQL Function: `rpc_transfer_operation`
- Updates `operations.created_by_user_id`
- Validates new case agent is a member
- Only current case agent can transfer

**Files:**
- `Views/TransferOperationSheet.swift` (NEW)
- `Docs/transfer_and_leave_operation.sql` (NEW)

---

### 3. **Leave Operation** (Team Members)
**Feature:** Team members can leave an operation at any time

**Workflow:**
1. Team member opens their active operation
2. Taps "Leave Operation" (orange button)
3. Confirms action
4. Removed from operation
5. System message notifies all members

**Database:**
- SQL Function: `rpc_leave_operation`
- Sets `operation_members.left_at` timestamp
- Sends system notification to chat

**Files:**
- `Docs/transfer_and_leave_operation.sql`

---

### 4. **End Operation** (Case Agent)
**Feature:** Case agents can end operations

**Workflow:**
1. Case agent opens their active operation
2. Taps "End Operation" (red button)
3. Confirms action
4. Operation status set to "ended"
5. All members removed

**Database:**
- SQL Function: `rpc_end_operation` (existing)
- Updates `operations.status = 'ended'`
- Sets `operations.ends_at` timestamp

---

### 5. **Clone Operation** (Ended Operations)
**Feature:** Case agents can duplicate ended operations with all targets/staging pre-filled

**Workflow:**
1. Case agent views an ended operation in "Previous Operations"
2. Taps "Clone Operation" (blue button)
3. Creation workflow opens with:
   - Operation name + " (Copy)"
   - Same incident number
   - All targets pre-filled
   - All staging areas pre-filled
4. Edit as needed
5. Create new operation

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Save time on recurring operations
- ✅ Maintain consistency across similar operations
- ✅ Quick setup for standard scenarios

**Technical:**
- No database changes required
- Data passed directly to `CreateOperationView`
- Images referenced (not duplicated)
- Targets/staging loaded even for non-members if case agent

**Files:**
- `Views/CreateOperationView.swift` (MODIFIED)
- `Views/ActiveOperationDetailView.swift` (MODIFIED)

---

### 6. **Hide Chat Input When No Active Operation**
**Feature:** Message input hidden when user isn't in an active operation

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents confusion about where messages go
- ✅ Cleaner empty state
- ✅ Clear visual indication of no active operation

**Files:**
- `Views/ChatView.swift` (MODIFIED)

---

## Database Changes

#### `rpc_transfer_operation(operation_id, new_case_agent_id)`
- Transfers case agent role to another member
- Validates caller is current case agent
- Validates new case agent is a member
- Sends system notification

#### `rpc_leave_operation(operation_id, user_id)`
- Removes user from operation
- Sets `left_at` timestamp
- Sends system notification
- Only user can leave for themselves

### SQL Files
- `Docs/transfer_and_leave_operation.sql` - Contains both functions

---

## Files Modified

### Views
- ✅ `Views/OperationsView.swift` - Direct details display
- ✅ `Views/ActiveOperationDetailView.swift` - All operation management buttons
- ✅ `Views/CreateOperationView.swift` - Clone operation support
- ✅ `Views/ChatView.swift` - Hide input when no active op
- ✅ `Views/TransferOperationSheet.swift` - NEW: Transfer UI

### Services
- ✅ `Services/SupabaseRPCService.swift` - New RPC functions

### Documentation
- ✅ `Docs/transfer_and_leave_operation.sql` - NEW: SQL functions
- ✅ `Docs/OP_SCREEN_CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - NEW: This file

## User Experience Flow

### Active Operation (Your Operation)
```
OperationsView
    ↓ (automatically shown)
ActiveOperationDetailView
    ├─ [Edit Operation] button
    ├─ [Transfer Operation] button (case agent only)
    ├─ [Leave Operation] button (members only)
    └─ [End Operation] button (case agent only)
```

### Previous Operation (You Created)
```
OperationsView
    └─ Previous Operations
        ↓ tap
    ActiveOperationDetailView
        └─ [Clone Operation] button (blue)
            ↓ tap
        CreateOperationView (with pre-filled data)
```

### Team Member Experience
```
Active Operation:
- See operation details immediately
- Can leave at any time
- Notified if case agent transfers
- Notified if someone leaves

Case Agent:
- All above, plus:
  - Transfer operation
  - End operation
  - Clone ended operations
```

## Testing Checklist

### Transfer Operation
- [ ] Only case agent sees button
- [ ] Transfer sheet lists all members
- [ ] Only active members can be selected
- [ ] System message sent to all
- [ ] New case agent sees management buttons
- [ ] Old case agent becomes regular member

### Leave Operation
- [ ] Only non-case-agent members see button
- [ ] Confirmation alert shown
- [ ] User removed from operation
- [ ] System message sent to all
- [ ] User moved to operations list

### End Operation
- [ ] Only case agent sees button
- [ ] Confirmation alert shown
- [ ] All members removed
- [ ] Operation moves to "Previous"
- [ ] Status set to "ended"

### Clone Operation
- [ ] Only visible for ended operations
- [ ] Only visible to case agent
- [ ] Button loads targets/staging
- [ ] Creation workflow opens
- [ ] Name has " (Copy)" suffix
- [ ] All targets pre-filled
- [ ] All staging pre-filled
- [ ] Can edit before creating

### Chat Input

- [ ] Empty state clear and informative

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Clone Operation:**
   - Images are referenced, not duplicated
   - Image URLs point to original operation
   - User can add new images

2. **Transfer Operation:**
   - Can only transfer to existing members
   - Cannot undo transfer (must transfer back)

3. **Leave Operation:**
   - Case agent cannot leave (must transfer first or end operation)
   - Cannot rejoin without approval

---

## Migration Notes

**No database migration required** - only new RPC functions need to be added.

### Setup Steps
1. Run `Docs/transfer_and_leave_operation.sql` in Supabase SQL editor
2. Grant execute permissions (included in SQL)
3. Deploy app updates

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Clone with Image Duplication**
   - Download original images
   - Upload with new UUIDs
   - Associate with new operation

2. **Transfer Confirmation for Recipient**
   - Notify new case agent
   - Require acceptance
   - Cancel if declined

3. **Bulk Operations**
   - Select multiple previous operations
   - Merge into one new operation
   - Combine targets/staging

4. **Operation Templates**
   - Save operation as template
   - Template library
   - Quick create from template

---

## Performance Considerations

- ✅ Targets/staging load only when needed
- ✅ Case agent check uses local state
- ✅ No additional DB queries for button visibility
- ✅ Clone operation passes data directly (no serialization)

---
