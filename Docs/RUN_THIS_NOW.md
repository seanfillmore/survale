# 🚀 FINAL SETUP - Run This Now!

## What's Fixed
1. ✅ Parameter order error (address before label)
2. ✅ Operation persistence (operations now load from database)
3. ✅ Target labels (custom labels work correctly)

## Action Required: Update Database

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar
3. Click "New Query"

### Step 2: Run Updated SQL Script
Copy and paste **ALL** contents of:
```
Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql
```

This file now contains **6 RPC functions:**
1. ✅ `rpc_create_person_target`
2. ✅ `rpc_create_vehicle_target`
3. ✅ `rpc_create_location_target` ← FIXED parameter order
4. ✅ `rpc_create_staging_point`
5. ✅ `rpc_get_operation_targets`
6. ✅ `rpc_get_user_operations` ← NEW for persistence

### Step 3: Click "Run"
Wait for: `✅ Simplified RPC functions created!`

### Step 4: Rebuild App
```bash
# In Xcode:
# 1. Cmd+Shift+K (Clean)
# 2. Cmd+B (Build)
# 3. Cmd+R (Run)
```

## Test Everything

### Test 1: Custom Labels (The Original Issue)
1. Create operation
2. Add location target
3. Enter custom label: "Suspect's Home"
4. Select address
5. Add target
6. Go to Map
7. ✅ Should see "Suspect's Home" (not address)
8. ✅ Should see it only once (no duplicates)

### Test 2: Operation Persistence (The New Issue)
1. Create operation "Test Persist"
2. Add 2 targets
3. **Close app completely**
4. Reopen app
5. Go to Ops tab
6. ✅ "Test Persist" should be in the list
7. Tap it to set active
8. Go to Map
9. ✅ All 2 targets should appear

### Test 3: Everything Together
1. Create operation "Final Test"
2. Add person target: "John Doe"
3. Add vehicle target: "Red Honda Civic"
4. Add location target with label "Meeting Point"
5. Add staging point "Base Camp"
6. Close app
7. Reopen app
8. Set "Final Test" as active
9. Go to Map
10. ✅ Should see:
    - "John Doe" (if has location)
    - "Red Honda Civic" (if has location)
    - "Meeting Point" (red pin)
    - "Base Camp" (green pin)

## Expected Console Output

```
💾 Creating operation...
💾 Saving 3 targets and 1 staging points to database...
  ✅ Saved target: John Doe
  ✅ Saved target: Red Honda Civic
  ✅ Saved target: Meeting Point
  ✅ Saved staging point: Base Camp
Operation created successfully

   📍 Staging from DB: Base Camp at (34.x, -118.x)
✅ Converted 3 targets

```

## What If It Doesn't Work?

### Error: "Could not find the function"
- Make sure you ran the **entire** `simple_target_rpc.sql` file
- Check Supabase SQL Editor for any red error messages

### Error: "column ... does not exist"
- Your database schema might not match
- Check `Docs/check_all_tables.sql` to verify your schema

### Operations Not Appearing After Restart
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor to check:
SELECT * FROM rpc_get_user_operations();
```
If this returns data, the problem is iOS side. If empty, operations aren't being saved.

### Targets Not Appearing on Map
- Make sure operation is set as "Active" in Ops tab
- Check console for "Loading targets" messages
- Verify coordinates exist for location targets

## Files Changed

### Database (SQL):
- ✅ `Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql` - All 6 RPC functions

### iOS (Swift):
- ✅ `Services/SupabaseRPCService.swift` - Fixed parameter order + added getUserOperations()
- ✅ `OperationStore.swift` - Implemented loadOperations() + fixed parameter order
- ✅ `Views/OperationsView.swift` - Added auto-reload after creating

## Summary

This is the **final fix** for both issues:
1. **Custom labels** - Fixed parameter order (address before label)
2. **Operation persistence** - Implemented full database loading

After running the SQL script and rebuilding, your app will:
- ✅ Save operations to database
- ✅ Load operations on startup
- ✅ Show custom labels correctly
- ✅ Persist targets and staging points
- ✅ Work across app restarts
- ✅ Ready for multi-device testing

## You're Done! 🎉

Once this works, you have a fully functional MVP ready for your 8-10 user test group!
