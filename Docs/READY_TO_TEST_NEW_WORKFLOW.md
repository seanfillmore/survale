# Ready to Test - New Operation Workflow (60% Complete)

## ✅ What's Working Now

### 1. No More Join Codes
- Join code functionality completely removed
- `JoinOperationView.swift` deleted
- "Join" button removed from UI
- Operations show incident number instead

### 2. See All Active Operations
- Operations list shows ALL active operations in the system
- Not just your operations - everyone's active operations visible
- Section title: "Active Operations"

### 3. Smart Operation Badges
Each operation shows context-aware badges:
- 🔵 **"Member"** - You are in this operation
- 🟢 **"Active"** - This is your currently active operation
- ⚪ **"Request"** button - Click to request joining this operation
- 🟠 **"Requested"** - You've requested to join (waiting for approval)

### 4. Request to Join Feature
- Click "Request" button on any operation you're not in
- Confirmation alert appears
- Request saved to database (`join_requests` table)
- Badge changes to "Requested" immediately
- Operation creator can approve/deny (admin feature - not implemented yet)

### 5. Database Functions
All RPC functions created in `simple_target_rpc.sql`:
- `rpc_get_all_active_operations()` - Get all active ops
- `rpc_request_join_operation()` - Send join request
- `rpc_create_person_target()` - Add person target
- `rpc_create_vehicle_target()` - Add vehicle target
- `rpc_create_location_target()` - Add location target
- `rpc_create_staging_point()` - Add staging point
- `rpc_get_operation_targets()` - Load targets/staging

---

## 🔄 Not Yet Implemented (40% Remaining)

### Missing Features
1. **Team Member Selection** - Can't add team members when creating operation
2. **One Operation Rule** - Can join multiple operations (constraint not enforced)
3. **Auto-Leave** - Don't auto-leave old operation when joining new one
4. **Current Operation Display** - Map/Chat don't show which operation is active
5. **Approve Join Requests** - No UI for operation creator to approve requests

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Setup
1. **Run SQL Script** in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```
   Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql
   ```
   This creates all necessary RPC functions.

2. **Ensure join_requests Table Exists:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS join_requests (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
       operation_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES operations(id),
       requester_user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
       status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'denied')),
       created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
       responded_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
       responder_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id)
   );
   ```

3. **Rebuild App:**
   ```
   Cmd+Shift+K (Clean)
   Cmd+B (Build)
   Cmd+R (Run)
   ```

### Test Case 1: View All Active Operations
1. User A creates "Operation Alpha"
2. Log in as User B
3. Go to Operations tab
4. ✅ Should see "Operation Alpha" in the list
5. ✅ Should show "Request" button (you're not a member)

### Test Case 2: Request to Join
1. As User B, tap "Request" on "Operation Alpha"
2. ✅ Confirmation alert appears
3. Tap "Request"
4. ✅ Badge changes to "Requested"
5. ✅ Database shows entry in `join_requests` table

### Test Case 3: Your Operations Show Correctly
1. As User A (who created "Operation Alpha")
2. Go to Operations tab
3. ✅ "Operation Alpha" shows "Member" badge (blue)
4. Tap the operation to set as active
5. ✅ "Active" badge appears (green)
6. ✅ Both "Member" and "Active" badges visible

### Test Case 4: Multiple Operations
1. User A creates "Operation Alpha" and "Operation Bravo"
2. User B creates "Operation Charlie"
3. As any user, view Operations tab
4. ✅ All 3 operations visible
5. ✅ Correct badges for each based on membership

## 📊 Expected Console Output

### On Login:
```
📥 Loading user context for userId: [uuid]
   ✅ User found: user@example.com
📥 Loading operations for user...
🔄 Loading all active operations...
🔄 Loaded 3 active operations from database
  ✅ Operation Alpha - Member: Yes
  ✅ Operation Bravo - Member: No
  ✅ Operation Charlie - Member: No
✅ Loaded 3 active operations
   👤 You are in: Operation Alpha
   • Operation Alpha - ✅ Member
   • Operation Bravo - ⭕️ Not member
   • Operation Charlie - ⭕️ Not member
```

### On Request to Join:
```
✅ Join request sent for operation: [uuid]
```

## 🐛 Potential Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "join_requests table does not exist"
**Solution:** Run the CREATE TABLE statement above in Supabase SQL Editor.

### Issue: Operations not loading
**Solution:** 
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify `rpc_get_all_active_operations()` exists:
   ```sql
   SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
   WHERE routine_name = 'rpc_get_all_active_operations';
   ```
3. Test function directly:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM rpc_get_all_active_operations();
   ```

### Issue: Request button doesn't work
**Solution:**
1. Check `join_requests` table exists
2. Check `rpc_request_join_operation()` exists
3. Look for error in console

### Issue: All operations show "Request" button
**Solution:**
- Operation membership not tracked correctly
- Check `operation_members` table has entries for your user
- Verify `left_at` is NULL for current memberships

## 🎯 What Works vs. What Doesn't

### ✅ Currently Working
- View all active operations
- See membership status (badges)
- Request to join operations
- Create operations (without team members)
- Add targets and staging points
- View targets on map
- Operations persist across app restarts

### ❌ Not Working Yet
- Select team members during creation
- Auto-add members to operation
- One-operation-at-a-time enforcement
- Approve/deny join requests
- Leave operation functionality
- Operation name in Map/Chat titles
- Notifications for join requests

- `SupabaseRPCService.swift` - New RPC functions
- `OperationsView.swift` - Complete redesign
- `Services/SupabaseAuthService.swift` - Updated loading
- `Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql` - New RPC functions

### To Be Created 🔄

## 🚀 Next Development Steps

If testing goes well and you want to continue:

1. **Create TeamMemberSelectorView** (1 hour)
   - Fetch team members from database
   - Show multi-select list
   - Track selected user IDs
   
2. **Add Team Members Step to CreateOperationView** (30 min)
   - Insert between Staging and Review
   - Wire up selector
   
3. **Create RPC for Adding Members** (45 min)
   - `rpc_add_operation_members()`
   - Implement one-operation constraint
   
4. **Update Navigation Titles** (15 min)
   - Show operation name in Map/Chat

**Total Remaining:** ~2.5 hours

## 💡 Current State Summary

**Status:** Compiles ✅ | Testable ✅ | 60% Complete

**What to Test:**
- Operations list UI
- Request to join workflow
- Badge display logic

**What to Skip:**
- Creating operations with team members (not ready)
- Expecting one-operation constraint (not implemented)
- Looking for operation names in Map/Chat (not added)
