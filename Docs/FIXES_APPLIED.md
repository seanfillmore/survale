# Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issue 1: Breadcrumbs Not in Sync

**Problem**: The progress circles at the top were using `hashValue` which is unstable and doesn't maintain order.

**Solution**: Changed to use `rawValue` from the `Comparable` extension:

```swift
// Before (using hashValue - unstable)
.fill(s.hashValue <= step.hashValue ? Color.blue : Color.gray.opacity(0.3))

// After (using rawValue - stable)
.fill(s.rawValue <= step.rawValue ? Color.blue : Color.gray.opacity(0.3))
```

**Result**: Progress breadcrumbs now correctly show which step you're on:
- Step 1 (Name): 1st circle blue
- Step 2 (Targets): 1st-2nd circles blue
- Step 3 (Staging): 1st-3rd circles blue
- Step 4 (Team Members): 1st-4th circles blue
- Step 5 (Review): All 5 circles blue

## ✅ Issue 2: No Team Members Listed in Step 4

**Root Cause**: You're likely the only user in your team, so after filtering out yourself (since you're the case agent), the list is empty.

**Solutions Applied**:

### 1. Better Empty State
Added a friendly message when no other team members exist:
- Shows icon and explanation
- Clarifies you can still create the operation
- Notes that you can add members later

### 2. Added Logging
```swift
print("📥 Loading team roster...")
print("✅ Loaded \(members.count) team members")
print("   Filtered to \(filteredMembers.count) members (excluding current user)")
```

This helps debug if the RPC function isn't working.

### 3. Filter Out Current User
The team member list now automatically excludes you (since you're already the case agent).

## 🧪 How to Test

### Option A: Add Test Users (Recommended)

1. Run this SQL script in Supabase:
   ```
   Docs/add_test_users.sql
   ```

2. This will add 3 test users to your team:
   - John Smith (BADGE001)
   - Jane Doe (BADGE002)
   - Mike Johnson (BADGE003)

3. Restart the app and go to Step 4 - you should now see these users!

### Option B: Create Operations Without Members

You can still create operations even if no other members exist:
1. Step 4 will show "No other team members"
2. Just tap "Next" to continue to Review
3. The operation will be created with just you as the case agent

## 📝 Why You're the Only Team Member

For MVP testing, the `mvp_simple_setup.sql` script assigns all users to one team. If you're the only user who has logged into the app, you'll be the only member of "MVP Team".

**To add more members**:
1. Have other users sign up and log in, OR
2. Run `Docs/add_test_users.sql` to create test users

---

## ✅ What Works Now

- ✅ Breadcrumbs correctly track progress through all 5 steps
- ✅ Step 4 loads team roster from database
- ✅ Current user (case agent) is filtered out
- ✅ Friendly message when no other members exist
- ✅ Can skip team member selection and still create operation
- ✅ Better logging to debug team roster loading

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run SQL**: Execute `Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql` if you haven't already
2. **Add Test Users**: Run `Docs/add_test_users.sql` to populate team roster
3. **Test Workflow**: Create a new operation and try all 5 steps
4. **Check Console**: Look for the "📥 Loading team roster..." logs

All fixed! 🎉
