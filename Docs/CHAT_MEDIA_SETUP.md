## 🚀 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Storage Bucket in Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** (left sidebar)
3. Click **New bucket**
4. Enter bucket name: `chat-media`
5. Check **Public bucket** ✅
6. Click **Create bucket**

### Step 2: Set Up Storage Policies

Run the SQL script to create RLS policies:

```bash
# Open Supabase SQL Editor and run:
Docs/setup_chat_media_storage.sql
```

This will:
- Create the `chat-media` bucket (if not already created)
- Add upload policy (users can upload to their operation's folder)
- Add download policy (users can view media from their operations)
- Add delete policy (users can delete their own media)

### Step 3: Test the Feature

1. **Rebuild the app** in Xcode
2. Join or create an active operation
3. Go to the **Messages** tab
4. Tap the **photo icon** (📷) to select a photo
5. Select one or more images/videos (up to 5)
6. Watch the upload progress
7. See the image appear in the chat!

## 📱 User Flow

### Sending a Photo:
1. Tap 📷 button
2. Select photo(s) from library
3. App uploads to `chat-media/{operationId}/{uuid}.jpg`
4. Message sent with media reference
5. Photo displays inline in chat bubble

### Sending a Video:
1. Tap 📷 button
2. Select video from library
3. App uploads to `chat-media/{operationId}/{uuid}.mp4`
4. Message sent with "📹 Video" text
5. Video placeholder displays (tap to play - coming soon)

### Sending Text:
1. Type message
2. Press Enter or tap send button
3. Message sent immediately

## 🗂️ Storage Structure

```
chat-media/
  └── {operation-uuid}/
      ├── {message-uuid-1}.jpg
      ├── {message-uuid-2}.jpg
      └── {message-uuid-3}.mp4
```

Each operation gets its own folder for organization and easy cleanup.

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ RLS policies ensure users can only access media from their operations
- ✅ Users can only upload to operations they're members of
- ✅ Media paths stored in database for reference
- ✅ Public bucket for easy CDN delivery
