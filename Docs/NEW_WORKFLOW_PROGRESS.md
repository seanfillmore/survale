# New Operation Workflow - Implementation Progress

## User's Requirements

### Operation Visibility
- ‚úÖ Show ALL active operations (not just user's)
- ‚úÖ Users can see operations they're NOT involved in
- üîÑ Users can request to join operations they're not in
- ‚úÖ Hide draft and ended operations

### One Active Operation Rule
- üîÑ User can only be in ONE active operation at a time
- üîÑ Auto-leave previous operation when joining new one

### Operation Creation (5 Steps)
1. Basic Info (name, incident number)
2. Targets
3. Staging Points
4. **NEW:** Select Team Members (roster)
   - Show all users in team
   - Gray out users already in an operation
   - Multi-select available users
   - On create: Add selected users + send notifications
5. Review

### States
- ‚úÖ Remove "draft" state
- ‚úÖ **Active:** Operation is ongoing (default for new operations)
- ‚úÖ **Ended:** Operation is completed

### Join Code
- ‚úÖ Remove completely (UI + database)

---

## Progress Summary

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### 1. Remove Join Code
- ‚úÖ Removed `joinCode` from `Operation` model
- ‚úÖ Removed from `Codable` extension (encode/decode)
- ‚úÖ Updated `OperationStore.create()` to not generate join codes
- ‚úÖ Updated `OperationsView` to show incident number instead of join code
- ‚úÖ Removed `find(byJoinCode:)` function, added `find(byId:)`
- ‚úÖ Removed `joinCode` from `SupabaseRPCService.getUserOperations()`

#### 2. Database RPC for Active Operations
- ‚úÖ Created `rpc_get_all_active_operations()` in SQL
- ‚úÖ Returns ALL active operations (not filtered by user)
- ‚úÖ Includes `is_member` flag to show if current user is in operation
- ‚úÖ Filters for `status = 'active'` only
- ‚úÖ Updated Swift service to `getAllActiveOperations()` returning `[(Operation, Bool)]`

#### 3. Default State Changes
- ‚úÖ Operations now default to `.active` state when created
- ‚úÖ `startsAt` set to creation date automatically

---

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS

### Current Task: Update OperationStore
Need to update `OperationStore.loadOperations()` to use new signature:
```swift
// OLD:
func loadOperations(for userID: UUID) async
let operations: [Operation] = try await rpcService.getUserOperations()

// NEW:
func loadOperations(for userID: UUID) async
let results: [(operation: Operation, isMember: Bool)] = try await rpcService.getAllActiveOperations()
```

Then update auth service to pass membership info.

---

## üìã REMAINING TASKS

### 3. Update OperationsView (Next)
- Show ALL active operations
- Add "Request to Join" button for non-member operations
- Show "You're in this operation" badge for member operations
- Update section title from "Your Operations" to "Active Operations"

### 4. Add Request to Join Functionality
- Create `RequestToJoinView` or inline button
- RPC function: `rpc_request_join_operation(operation_id UUID)`
- Notify operation creator

### 5. Reorder CreateOperationView Steps
- Step 1: Basic Info ‚úÖ
- Step 2: Targets ‚úÖ
- Step 3: Staging ‚úÖ
- Step 4: Team Members (NEW)
- Step 5: Review (moved from step 4)

### 6. Create TeamMemberSelector View
- Fetch all users in user's team
- Show list with checkboxes
- Gray out users already in an active operation
- Multi-select functionality
- Pass selected user IDs to next step

### 7. Create RPC Function for Adding Members
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.rpc_add_operation_members(
    operation_id UUID,
    user_ids UUID[]
)
```
- Add multiple members at once
- Check "one operation" constraint
- Auto-leave previous operations if needed

### 8. Implement One Operation Constraint
- When user joins operation, check if they're in another active one
- If yes, automatically set `left_at` on previous membership
- Update `AppState.activeOperationID` to new operation

### 9. Update UI for Current Operation
- Clearly show which operation user is currently in
- Maybe add avatar/icon in tab bar?
- Badge on Map/Chat tabs showing operation name?

### 10. Remove JoinOperationView
- Delete `Views/JoinOperationView.swift`
- Remove "Join" button from `OperationsView` toolbar
- Remove sheet binding

## Files Modified So Far

### Swift Files ‚úÖ
- `/Users/seanfillmore/Code/Survale/Survale/Operation.swift`
  - Removed `joinCode` property
  - Updated init to default `state = .active`
  - Removed `joinCode` from `Codable` extension
  - Updated `mock()` function

- `/Users/seanfillmore/Code/Survale/Survale/Services/SupabaseRPCService.swift`
  - Renamed `getUserOperations()` to `getAllActiveOperations()`
  - Changed return type to include `isMember` flag
  - Updated RPC call to `rpc_get_all_active_operations`

- `/Users/seanfillmore/Code/Survale/Survale/OperationStore.swift`
  - Removed join code generation in `create()`
  - Set `state = .active` by default
  - Set `startsAt = Date()` on creation
  - Changed `find(byJoinCode:)` to `find(byId:)`

- `/Users/seanfillmore/Code/Survale/Survale/Views/OperationsView.swift`
  - Changed "Join code" display to "Incident" number

### SQL Files ‚úÖ
- `/Users/seanfillmore/Code/Survale/Survale/Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql`
  - Created `rpc_get_all_active_operations()`
  - Returns ALL active operations
  - Includes `is_member` subquery
  - Filters `WHERE status = 'active'`

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Finish OperationStore update** (in progress)
2. **Update OperationsView** to show all active operations with request buttons
3. **Create TeamMemberSelector view** for step 4
4. **Create RPC for adding members** bulk operation
5. **Implement one-operation constraint** in RPC
6. **Reorder CreateOperationView steps**
7. **Add request-to-join functionality**
8. **Remove JoinOperationView** and related UI
9. **Update UI to show current operation clearly**

---

## Testing Plan (After Implementation)

### Test 1: See All Active Operations
1. User A creates Operation "Alpha"
2. User B logs in
3. ‚úÖ User B should see Operation "Alpha" in list
4. ‚úÖ Should show "Request to Join" button

### Test 2: One Operation Constraint
1. User A creates and joins Operation "Alpha"
2. User A creates Operation "Bravo"
3. User A joins Operation "Bravo"
4. ‚úÖ User A should auto-leave "Alpha"
5. ‚úÖ Only "Bravo" should show as active for User A

### Test 3: Team Member Selection
1. User A creates new operation
2. Goes to step 4 (Team Members)
3. ‚úÖ Sees all team members
4. ‚úÖ Members in other operations are grayed out
5. ‚úÖ Can select multiple available members
6. ‚úÖ Selected members added on operation creation

### Test 4: No Join Code
1. Create operation
2. ‚úÖ No join code generated
3. ‚úÖ No join code displayed
4. ‚úÖ No "Join" button in UI
5. ‚úÖ Can only join via invitation or request

---

## Database Schema Changes Needed

### operations table
- ‚ùå Don't need `join_code` column anymore (can ignore if exists)
- ‚úÖ `status` column exists (`active`, `ended`)

### operation_members table
- ‚úÖ `left_at` column for tracking when user left

### New RPC Functions Needed
1. `rpc_get_all_active_operations()` ‚úÖ Created
2. `rpc_request_join_operation(operation_id UUID)` - Creates join request
3. `rpc_add_operation_members(operation_id UUID, user_ids UUID[])` - Bulk add
4. `rpc_leave_operation(operation_id UUID)` - Leave current operation
5. `rpc_get_team_members(team_id UUID)` - Get roster with availability

**Status:** ~40% complete. Core refactoring done, now implementing new features.

**Est. Remaining:** ~2-3 hours of focused implementation + testing
