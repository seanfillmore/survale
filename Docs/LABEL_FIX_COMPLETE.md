# Label Fix Complete - Custom Labels Working

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
1. Location target labels were showing the address twice
2. Custom labels (e.g., "Suspect's Home") were not being saved or loaded from database
3. Address was always showing instead of the custom label

### Solution
Updated 5 files to properly save, retrieve, and display custom labels:

## Changes Made

### 1. Database (simple_target_rpc.sql)
- Added `label` parameter to `rpc_create_location_target`
- Stores custom label in JSONB data column
- Returns label when fetching targets
- Falls back to address if no custom label provided

### 2. iOS RPC Service (SupabaseRPCService.swift)
- Added `label` parameter to `createLocationTarget`
- Receives `label` from database response
- Sets `target.label` from database (prioritizes custom label)

### 3. Operation Store (OperationStore.swift)
- Passes `target.locationName` as the label parameter when creating

### 4. Map View (MapOperationView.swift)
- Changed Annotation title to empty string `""`
- Only shows label in the pin's Text view (no duplicate)
- Clean, single label display

### 5. Create Operation View (CreateOperationView.swift)
- Already had custom label field and logic âœ…

## How It Works Now

### Creating a Location Target:
1. User enters label: "Suspect's Home"
2. User selects address: "2164 N Goddard Ave, Simi Valley, 93063"
3. Label is saved to database as: `data->>'label'` = "Suspect's Home"
4. Address is saved as: `data->>'address'` = "2164 N Goddard Ave, Simi Valley, 93063"

### Loading from Database:
1. Query returns: `{ label: "Suspect's Home", address: "2164...", lat: 34.x, lon: -118.x }`
2. iOS creates OpTarget with `locationName` = "Suspect's Home"
3. Target label is set to "Suspect's Home"

### Displaying on Map:
1. Annotation title = "" (no callout label)
2. Pin shows: RED marker + "Suspect's Home" text below
3. Clean, single label - no duplicates!

## Testing

### Step 1: Re-run SQL
Run `Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### Step 2: Rebuild App
Cmd+B, Cmd+R in Xcode

### Step 3: Create NEW Operation
(Old operations won't have labels saved)

1. Create operation
2. Add location target
3. Enter label: "Test Location"
4. Select address
5. Add target
6. Go to Map

### Expected Result:
- RED pin with "Test Location" label (not the full address)
- No duplicate text
- Clean, professional look

## Verify in Database

```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    type,
    data->>'label' as label,
    data->>'address' as address,
    (data->>'latitude')::double precision as lat,
    (data->>'longitude')::double precision as lng
FROM targets
WHERE type = 'location'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Should show:
- `label`: "Suspect's Home" (or whatever you entered)
- `address`: "2164 N Goddard Ave, Simi Valley, 93063" (full address)
- `lat`: 34.xxxx
- `lng`: -118.xxxx

## Fallback Behavior

If no custom label is provided:
- Label defaults to full address
- Same as before, but now you have the option for custom labels!

## Benefits

âœ… Meaningful labels on map ("Suspect's Home" vs long address)
âœ… Cleaner map display (no duplicates)
âœ… Professional appearance
âœ… Works across all devices (label syncs via database)
âœ… Optional - can still use address if you want

Perfect for MVP testing! ðŸŽ‰
