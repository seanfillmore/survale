# Bugfix: Transfer Operation No Members

## Branch: `bugfix/transfer-operation-no-members`

This branch fixes critical bugs in the Transfer Operation feature and adds a "Coming Soon" placeholder for the Replay tab.

## 🐛 Bug Fixed: Transfer Operation Sheet Empty

### Problem
Transfer Operation sheet showed "No other members available" even though team members existed.

### Root Cause
SwiftUI's `.sheet(isPresented:)` captures closure values at definition time, not presentation time. The sheet closure captured `operationMembers = []` (initial empty array) before members finished loading asynchronously.

### Solution
Changed from `.sheet(isPresented:)` to `.sheet(item:)`:
1. Created `TransferSheetData` wrapper struct (Identifiable)
2. Load members when button is pressed
3. Set `transferSheetData = TransferSheetData(members: operationMembers)`
4. Sheet closure evaluates with fresh data each time

### Technical Details
```swift
// Before (BROKEN)
@State private var showingTransferSheet = false
@State private var operationMembers: [User] = []

.sheet(isPresented: $showingTransferSheet) {
    TransferOperationSheet(operation: operation, members: operationMembers)
    // ❌ Captures empty array at view build time
}

// After (FIXED)
@State private var transferSheetData: TransferSheetData?
@State private var operationMembers: [User] = []

Button {
    Task {
        await loadOperationMembers()  // Wait for data
        transferSheetData = TransferSheetData(members: operationMembers)
    }
}

.sheet(item: $transferSheetData) { data in
    TransferOperationSheet(operation: operation, members: data.members)
    // ✅ Fresh data on each presentation
}
```

## 🗄️ SQL Column Name Fixes

### Issues Found
1. `created_by_user_id` doesn't exist → should be `case_agent_id`
2. `case_agent_user_id` doesn't exist → should be `case_agent_id`
3. `user_id` in `op_messages` doesn't exist → should be `sender_user_id`
4. `text` in `op_messages` doesn't exist → should be `body_text`
5. `kind` in `op_messages` doesn't exist → should be `media_type`

### Files Fixed
- `Docs/transfer_and_leave_operation.sql` (main SQL file)
- `Docs/fix_transfer_operation_column.sql` (reference/backup)

### Correct Column Names
**operations table:**
- ✅ `case_agent_id` - stores the case agent's user ID

**op_messages table:**
- ✅ `sender_user_id` - who sent the message
- ✅ `body_text` - message content
- ✅ `media_type` - 'text', 'photo', 'video'

## 🎨 Replay Tab Update

### Change
Replaced non-functional replay controls with "Coming Soon" message.

### Removed
- Slider control
- Play/pause/forward/back buttons
- State variables for playback

### Added
- Centered "Coming Soon" layout
- Clock circular arrow icon
- Descriptive text
- Clean empty state

### Why
The replay feature is planned for a future update. Better to show a clear "Coming Soon" message than non-functional controls.

## 📊 Testing Results

### Transfer Operation (Fixed)
```
✅ Members load before sheet appears
✅ Sheet receives correct member list
✅ Filtering works (excludes current user)
✅ Can select team members
✅ Transfer updates database
✅ System notification sent
```

### Member Loading Logs (Success)
```
👥 Loaded 2 operation members for transfer:
   - DA308 (sean@sean.com)
   - 5E22 (test@test.com)
📋 TransferOperationSheet: Received 2 members
   After filtering current user: 1 members ✅
```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: SQL Migration
Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- File: Docs/transfer_and_leave_operation.sql
-- Creates rpc_transfer_operation and rpc_leave_operation
```

### Step 2: Merge Branch
```bash
# Merge bugfix into feature branch
git checkout feature/op-screen-changes
git merge bugfix/transfer-operation-no-members

# Or merge directly to main if feature branch already merged
git checkout main
git merge bugfix/transfer-operation-no-members
```

### Step 3: Test
- Transfer operation between team members
- Verify system messages appear in chat
- Check Replay tab shows "Coming Soon"
