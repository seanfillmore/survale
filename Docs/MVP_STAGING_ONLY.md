# MVP - Staging Points Only (No Targets)

## Issue Found
Your database doesn't have the target tables (`target_person`, `target_vehicle`, `target_location`) yet.

## Solution for MVP
Updated the RPC functions to:
1. ✅ **Staging points**: Fully functional - saves to database and displays on map
2. ⚠️ **Targets**: Placeholder functions - won't save to database but won't error

This lets you test the core MVP feature (staging points on map) without needing the target tables.

## What Changed

### RPC Functions (create_target_rpc_functions.sql)
- `rpc_create_person_target` → Returns dummy ID (no database write)
- `rpc_create_vehicle_target` → Returns dummy ID (no database write)
- `rpc_create_location_target` → Returns dummy ID (no database write)
- `rpc_create_staging_point` → **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** ✅
- `rpc_get_operation_targets` → Only returns staging points (targets always empty array)

### App Behavior
When you create an operation with targets + staging:
```
💾 Saving 3 targets and 1 staging points to database...
  ✅ Saved target: John Doe         ← Dummy ID, not in DB
  ✅ Saved target: Blue Honda       ← Dummy ID, not in DB
  ✅ Saved target: 123 Main St      ← Dummy ID, not in DB
  ✅ Saved staging point: HOJ       ← REAL, saved to DB ✅
```

### Map Display
- **Staging points**: Show as GREEN pins 🟢
- **Targets**: Won't show (not in database)

## Setup

### Re-run SQL Script (Final!)
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy entire `Docs/create_target_rpc_functions.sql`
3. Paste and Run

### Test
1. Rebuild app
2. Create operation with **staging point only** (skip targets for now)
3. Go to Map tab
4. You should see GREEN pin!

## Expected Console Output

```
🔄 Loading targets for operation: [uuid]
🔍 RPC Response: 0 targets, 1 staging
   📍 Staging from DB: HOJ at (37.7749, -122.4194)
✅ Converted 1 staging points
📍 Loaded 0 targets and 1 staging points
   Staging: HOJ at (37.7749, -122.4194)
Showing 1 staging point(s)
```

## Why This Approach?

For your MVP with 8-10 testers, you need:
- ✅ Multi-user map view
- ✅ Real-time location tracking
- ✅ Staging points (meeting locations)

Targets are nice-to-have but not critical for initial testing. You can add the target tables later when needed.

## Adding Target Tables Later

When you're ready to add full target support:
1. Create the target tables in Supabase:
   - `targets` (main table)
   - `target_person`
   - `target_vehicle`
   - `target_location`
2. Update the RPC functions to use real INSERT statements
3. Targets will then appear as RED pins on the map

For now, focus on **staging points** - that's what matters for MVP!
