# Timestamp Parsing Fix ✅

## Problem
```
❌ Invalid created_at date: 2025-10-19T18:52:25.641528+00:00
```

Operations were being skipped because the date parser couldn't handle fractional seconds (microseconds).

## Root Cause

**Database format:**
```
2025-10-19T18:52:25.641528+00:00
                    ^^^^^^^ microseconds
```

**Default ISO8601DateFormatter:**
- Only parses basic ISO8601 format
- Doesn't handle fractional seconds by default

## Solution

**File:** `Services/SupabaseRPCService.swift`

Added `.withFractionalSeconds` option to formatter:

```swift
let dateFormatter = ISO8601DateFormatter()
dateFormatter.formatOptions = [.withInternetDateTime, .withFractionalSeconds]
```

### What This Does

- `.withInternetDateTime` - Standard ISO8601 format (date + time + timezone)
- `.withFractionalSeconds` - Parses microseconds/milliseconds after seconds

Now handles both formats:
- ✅ `2025-10-19T18:52:25+00:00` (no fractional seconds)
- ✅ `2025-10-19T18:52:25.641528+00:00` (with fractional seconds)

## Action Required

**Just rebuild the app:**
```
Cmd+Shift+K (Clean)
Cmd+B (Build)
Cmd+R (Run)
```

No database changes needed!

```

## Why This Happened

PostgreSQL `TIMESTAMPTZ` columns store timestamps with microsecond precision. When Supabase returns these as JSON, they include the fractional seconds by default.

Common timestamp formats from PostgreSQL:
```
NOW()                    → 2025-10-19T18:52:25.641528+00:00
NOW()::timestamp(0)      → 2025-10-19T18:52:25+00:00 (no fractions)
```

The iOS app now handles both formats! ✅

## Status: Fixed! 🎉

All "Pied Piper" operations (and any others with fractional seconds) will now load correctly.

Just rebuild and test - no other changes needed!
