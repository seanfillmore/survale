# Auto-Load Operations on Login ✅

## Problem
Operations were only loaded when viewing the Operations tab. The app should check for active operations immediately when the user logs in.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Load Operations on Login ✅
**File:** `Services/SupabaseAuthService.swift`

Updated `loadUserContext()` to:
- Load all operations for the user
- Check for active operations
- Automatically restore active operation state

```swift
// After loading user/team/agency data...

// Load operations for this user
print("📥 Loading operations for user...")
await OperationStore.shared.loadOperations(for: userId)

// Check if user has an active operation and restore it
if let activeOp = OperationStore.shared.operations.first(where: { $0.state == .active }) {
    print("✅ Found active operation: \(activeOp.name)")
    appState?.activeOperationID = activeOp.id
    appState?.activeOperation = activeOp
}
```

### 2. Clear on Logout ✅
**File:** `Services/SupabaseAuthService.swift`

Updated `signOut()` to:
- Clear user context
- Clear active operation
- Clear operations list

```swift
func signOut() async throws {
    try await client.auth.signOut()
    
    // Clear user context and active operation
    appState?.currentUser = nil
    appState?.currentTeam = nil
    appState?.currentAgency = nil
    appState?.activeOperationID = nil
    appState?.activeOperation = nil
    
    // Clear operations from store
    await OperationStore.shared.clearOperations()
}
```

### 3. Clear Operations Helper ✅
**File:** `OperationStore.swift`

Added `clearOperations()` method:
```swift
func clearOperations() async {
    self.operations = []
    self.isLoading = false
    self.error = nil
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Login Flow:
```
1. User enters credentials
2. SupabaseAuthService.signIn() called
   ↓
3. Auth state listener triggers
   ↓
4. loadUserContext() called automatically
   ↓
5. User data loaded ✅
6. Team data loaded ✅
7. Agency data loaded ✅
8. Operations loaded ✅        ← NEW!
9. Active operation restored ✅ ← NEW!
   ↓
10. User sees MainTabsView
11. If active operation exists:
    - Map tab shows pins immediately
    - Chat tab is ready
    - Operations tab shows "Active" badge
```

### Expected Console Output on Login:

```
📥 Loading user context for userId: [uuid]
   Fetching user from database...
   ✅ User found: user@example.com
📥 Loading operations for user...
🔄 Loading operations for user: [uuid]
🔄 Loaded 3 operations from database
   📦 Raw operation: Operation Alpha
      ...
  ✅ Loaded: Operation Alpha (active)
  ✅ Loaded: Operation Bravo (draft)
  ✅ Loaded: Operation Charlie (ended)
✅ Loaded 3 operations
   • Operation Alpha - active - created: 2024-10-19 14:23:45
   • Operation Bravo - draft - created: 2024-10-19 13:15:22
   • Operation Charlie - ended - created: 2024-10-19 10:05:11
✅ Found active operation: Operation Alpha
```

### Logout Flow:
```
1. User taps Logout
2. SupabaseAuthService.signOut() called
   ↓
3. Clear all user data ✅
4. Clear active operation ✅
5. Clear operations list ✅
   ↓
6. User sees LoginView
```

## Benefits

### Before (❌):
- Login → See MainTabsView
- Go to Ops tab → Wait for operations to load
- Manually select an operation as active
- Go to Map tab → Finally see pins

### After (✅):
- Login → Operations load in background
- Active operation auto-restored
- Go to Map tab → Pins appear immediately!
- Go to Chat tab → Ready to send messages
- Operations tab → Shows "Active" badge

## Testing

### Test 1: Fresh Login with Active Operation
1. Ensure you have an operation with `status = 'active'` in database
2. Log out completely
3. Log in
4. Check console for "✅ Found active operation"
5. Go to Map tab
6. ✅ Should see target/staging pins immediately

### Test 2: Fresh Login without Active Operation
1. Ensure all operations are `status = 'draft'` or `'ended'`
2. Log out
3. Log in
4. Check console for "ℹ️ No active operation found"
5. Go to Ops tab
6. ✅ Should see list of operations
7. ✅ No "Active" badge

### Test 3: Resume Active Operation
1. Create new operation "Test Resume"
2. Set it as active (status = 'active' in database)
3. Close app completely
4. Reopen app
5. ✅ Should auto-resume "Test Resume" as active
6. ✅ Map should show pins immediately

### Test 4: Logout Cleanup
1. Log in with active operation
2. Check operations list is populated
3. Log out
4. Log back in as different user
5. ✅ Should only see that user's operations
6. ✅ Previous user's active operation should not appear

## Database Query to Set Operation as Active

To test, manually set an operation to active:

```sql
-- Make an operation active
UPDATE operations
SET status = 'active'
WHERE id = '[operation-id]';

-- Or make the most recent operation active
UPDATE operations
SET status = 'active'
WHERE id = (
    SELECT id 
    FROM operations 
    WHERE case_agent_id = auth.uid()
    ORDER BY created_at DESC 
    LIMIT 1
);
```

## Implementation Details

### Thread Safety
- `loadUserContext()` is `async` and properly awaits
- `MainActor.run` used for UI updates
- `OperationStore.shared` is thread-safe

### Performance
- Operations load in parallel with UI rendering
- No blocking on main thread
- Progressive loading (user context first, then operations)

### Error Handling
- If operation loading fails, user context still loads
- Error logged but doesn't block login
- User can still use app, operations just won't appear

## Future Enhancements

1. **Loading Indicator:** Show spinner in Ops tab while loading
2. **Pull to Refresh:** Allow manual refresh of operations list
3. **Push Notifications:** Alert when operation state changes
4. **Background Sync:** Keep operations updated while app is open
5. **Offline Support:** Cache operations locally

## Status: Complete ✅

Operations now load automatically on login and active operations are restored!

No additional setup required - just rebuild and test!
