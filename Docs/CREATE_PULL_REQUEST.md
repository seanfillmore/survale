# Operation Screen UX Improvements

## 🎯 Overview

This PR introduces significant UX improvements to the Operations screen and operation management workflows, including the ability to transfer operations, leave operations, and clone ended operations.

## ✨ Features

### 1. Direct Operation Details Display
- Active operations now show details immediately on the Operations screen
- Eliminates unnecessary navigation tap
- Dynamic title: "Active Operation" vs "Operations"

### 2. Transfer Operation (Case Agent)
- Orange button in active operation details
- Transfer case agent role to another team member
- System message notifies all members
- SQL: `rpc_transfer_operation`

### 3. Leave Operation (Team Members)
- Orange button for non-case-agent members
- Remove self from operation
- System message notifies all members
- SQL: `rpc_leave_operation`

### 4. End Operation (Case Agent)
- Red button to end operation for everyone
- Moves operation to "Previous Operations"
- All members removed
- SQL: `rpc_end_operation` (existing)

### 5. Clone Operation (Ended Operations) ⭐
- Blue button in ended operation details
- Create new operation with same targets/staging
- Operation name + " (Copy)"
- All targets and locations pre-filled
- No database changes required

### 6. Hide Chat Input
- Message input hidden when no active operation
- Cleaner empty state with clear instructions

## 📊 Changes
