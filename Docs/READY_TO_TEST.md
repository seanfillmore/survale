# 🎉 Ready to Test - Complete Setup

## What's Implemented

### ✅ Operation Persistence
- Operations save to database
- Operations load from database
- Persist across app restarts

### ✅ Auto-Load on Login
- Operations load when user logs in
- Active operations automatically restored
- No manual selection needed

### ✅ Target & Staging Persistence
- Person targets saved/loaded
- Vehicle targets saved/loaded
- Location targets saved/loaded (with custom labels!)
- Staging points saved/loaded

### ✅ Map Display
- Target locations show as red pins
- Staging points show as green pins
- Custom labels display correctly
- No duplicate labels

## Final Setup Steps

### 1. Database Setup

Run this SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor:
```
Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql
```

This includes all 6 RPC functions:
- `rpc_create_operation`
- `rpc_create_person_target`
- `rpc_create_vehicle_target`
- `rpc_create_location_target` (fixed parameter order)
- `rpc_create_staging_point`
- `rpc_get_operation_targets`
- `rpc_get_user_operations` (NEW - for auto-load)

### 2. Fix Existing Operations (if needed)

If you have operations that fail to load (like "Pied Piper"), run:

```sql
-- Check for NULL team/agency
SELECT id, name, team_id, agency_id
FROM operations
WHERE team_id IS NULL OR agency_id IS NULL;

-- Fix them
UPDATE operations
SET 
    team_id = COALESCE(team_id, (SELECT id FROM teams WHERE name = 'MVP Team')),
    agency_id = COALESCE(agency_id, (SELECT id FROM agencies WHERE name = 'MVP Agency'))
WHERE team_id IS NULL OR agency_id IS NULL;
```

### 3. Rebuild App

In Xcode:
```
Cmd+Shift+K  (Clean)
Cmd+B        (Build)
Cmd+R        (Run)
```

## Complete Test Flow

### Test 1: Create Operation with Targets
1. ✅ Log in
2. ✅ Go to Ops tab
3. ✅ Tap "+" to create operation
4. ✅ Enter name: "Test MVP"
5. ✅ Add person target: "John Doe"
6. ✅ Add vehicle target: "Red Honda"
7. ✅ Add location target:
   - Custom label: "Meeting Point"
   - Search and select address
   - ✅ Address autocompletes as you type
   - ✅ City/ZIP populate automatically
8. ✅ Add staging point:
   - Label: "Base Camp"
   - Search and select address
9. ✅ Tap "Create"
10. ✅ Check console:
```
💾 Creating operation...
  ✅ Saved target: John Doe
  ✅ Saved target: Red Honda
  ✅ Saved target: Meeting Point
  ✅ Saved staging point: Base Camp
Operation created successfully
```

### Test 2: Verify Persistence
1. ✅ Close app completely (swipe up in app switcher)
2. ✅ Reopen app
3. ✅ Log in
4. ✅ Check console:
```
📥 Loading operations for user...
🔄 Loaded 1 operations from database
  ✅ Loaded: Test MVP (draft)
✅ Loaded 1 operations
ℹ️ No active operation found
```
5. ✅ Go to Ops tab
6. ✅ See "Test MVP" in list

### Test 3: View on Map
1. ✅ In Ops tab, tap "Test MVP" to set as active
2. ✅ See "Active" badge appear
3. ✅ Go to Map tab
4. ✅ Check console:
```
🔄 Loading targets for operation: [uuid]
🔍 RPC Response: 3 targets, 1 staging
  ✅ Loaded: John Doe
  ✅ Loaded: Red Honda
  ✅ Loaded: Meeting Point
📍 Staging: Base Camp at (34.x, -118.x)
📍 Loaded 3 targets and 1 staging points
```
5. ✅ See map with:
   - 🔴 Red pin: "Meeting Point" (with custom label, no duplicate)
   - 🟢 Green pin: "Base Camp"

### Test 4: Active Operation Auto-Restore
1. ✅ In Supabase, run:
```sql
UPDATE operations
SET status = 'active'
WHERE name = 'Test MVP';
```
2. ✅ Close app completely
3. ✅ Reopen app
4. ✅ Log in
5. ✅ Check console:
```
✅ Found active operation: Test MVP
```
6. ✅ Go to Map tab immediately
7. ✅ Pins should appear without manually selecting operation!

### Test 5: Multi-Device (Future)
1. ✅ Create operation on Device A
2. ✅ Log in on Device B (same user)
3. ✅ Should see operation on Device B
4. ✅ Should see same targets on map

## Expected Console Output (Full Login)

```
📥 Loading user context for userId: [uuid]
   Fetching user from database...
   ✅ User found: user@example.com
📥 Loading operations for user...
🔄 Loading operations for user: [uuid]
🔄 Loaded 1 operations from database
   📦 Raw operation: Test MVP
      id: [uuid]
      case_agent_id: [uuid]
      team_id: [uuid]
      agency_id: [uuid]
      created_at: 2024-10-19T15:45:22Z
  ✅ Loaded: Test MVP (active)
✅ Loaded 1 operations
   • Test MVP - active - created: 2024-10-19 15:45:22
✅ Found active operation: Test MVP
```

## Troubleshooting

### Operations Not Loading?
See: `Docs/DEBUG_PARSING.md`
- Check console for specific error
- Run `Docs/debug_operations.sql` to check database

### Targets Not Appearing?
- Ensure operation is set as "Active" in Ops tab
- Check console for "Loading targets" messages
- Verify coordinates exist: `SELECT * FROM targets WHERE operation_id = '[id]'`

### Custom Labels Not Showing?
- Re-run `Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql`
- Check parameter order is correct (address before label)

### Still Getting Parse Errors?
See: `Docs/DEBUG_PARSING.md`
- Enhanced logging will show exact field causing issue
- Most likely: NULL team_id or agency_id

## Files Changed Summary

### Database (SQL):
- ✅ `simple_target_rpc.sql` - All 6 RPC functions

### iOS (Swift):
- ✅ `SupabaseAuthService.swift` - Auto-load on login + clear on logout
- ✅ `SupabaseRPCService.swift` - Fixed parameter order + getUserOperations()
- ✅ `OperationStore.swift` - loadOperations() + clearOperations()
- ✅ `OperationsView.swift` - Auto-reload after creating
- ✅ `CreateOperationView.swift` - Modern UI + address autocomplete
- ✅ `AddressSearchField.swift` - NEW: Reusable address search
- ✅ `MapOperationView.swift` - Display targets/staging
- ✅ `Operation.swift` - StagingPoint.coordinate property
- ✅ `OpTargetModels.swift` - OpTarget.coordinate property

## What Works Now 🎉

✅ **Full CRUD Operations**
- Create operations
- Read operations (from database)
- Update operations (draft → active → ended)
- Delete operations (future)

✅ **Full Target Management**
- Person targets (name, phone)
- Vehicle targets (make, model, color, plate)
- Location targets (address, coordinates, custom label)
- Staging points (label, coordinates)

✅ **Auto-Restore State**
- Active operation persists
- Loads on login
- Displays on map immediately

✅ **Address Autocomplete**
- MapKit integration
- City/ZIP auto-populate
- Coordinates captured
- Keyboard dismisses on selection

✅ **Map Visualization**
- Red pins for targets
- Green pins for staging
- Custom labels (no duplicates)
- Auto-loads on operation change

## Next Steps for MVP

1. ✅ Test with 2-3 devices
2. ✅ Create 5-10 test operations
3. ✅ Verify persistence works reliably
4. ✅ Test with poor network connection
5. ✅ Ready for 8-10 user test group!
