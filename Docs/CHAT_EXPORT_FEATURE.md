## Overview
The Chat Export feature allows any member of an ended operation to export the full chat transcript as a PDF report, along with all media files (photos and videos) downloaded locally to their device.

## Feature Specifications

### Availability
- ‚úÖ Only visible when operation `state == .ended`
- ‚úÖ Available to **all members** (not just Case Agent)
- ‚úÖ Accessed from the **Operation Details** screen

### Export Contents
1. **PDF Report** (`Chat_Export_[OperationName]_[timestamp].pdf`)
   - Cover page with operation metadata
   - Incident number, dates, participant list
   - Filters applied (if any)
   - Full chat transcript with:
     - Timestamp and user name for each message
     - Message content
     - Media thumbnails (100x100px) for photos
     - Video placeholders with üìπ icon
     - Filename for each media item

2. **Media Folder** (`Chat_Media_[OperationName]_[timestamp]/`)
   - Full-resolution photos
   - Video files
   - Original filenames preserved

### Filtering Options
Users can filter the export by:

1. **Date/Time Range**
   - From: [Date & Time]
   - To: [Date & Time]
   - Default: Full operation duration

2. **Members**
   - Multi-select from operation members
   - Default: All members included

## Implementation

### Files Created

#### 1. `Services/ChatExportService.swift`
Core export service that handles:
- Fetching messages from database
- Downloading media from Supabase Storage
- Generating PDF using PDFKit
- Organizing media files in a folder

**Key Methods:**
```swift
func exportChat(
    operationId: UUID,
    operation: Operation,
    members: [User],
    filters: ChatExportFilters = ChatExportFilters()
) async throws -> ChatExportResult
```

#### 2. `Views/ChatExportFilterView.swift`
SwiftUI view for filter selection:
- Date/time pickers
- Member selection with checkboxes
- Export preview information
- Validation (e.g., at least one member must be selected)

#### 3. Updated `Views/ActiveOperationDetailView.swift`
- Added "Export Chat Report" button (only visible for ended operations)
- Sheet presentation for filter view
- Export progress indicator
- Error handling and display
- iOS share sheet integration

### Data Flow

```
User taps "Export Chat Report"
    ‚Üì
ChatExportFilterView presented
    ‚Üì
User selects filters (optional)
    ‚Üì
User taps "Export"
    ‚Üì
ChatExportService.exportChat() called
    ‚Üì
1. Fetch all messages from database
2. Apply filters
3. Download media files
4. Generate PDF with PDFKit
5. Organize media in folder
    ‚Üì
iOS Share Sheet presented
    ‚Üì
User selects destination:
- Save to Files
- AirDrop
- Email
- Other apps
```

### Database Query

Messages are fetched with a JOIN to get user names:

```swift
.from("op_messages")
.select("*, users!sender_user_id(full_name)")
.eq("operation_id", value: operationId.uuidString)
.order("created_at", ascending: true)
```

### PDF Generation

Using `UIGraphicsPDFRenderer`:
- **Page Size**: 612 x 792 points (US Letter)
- **Margins**: 50 points
- **Cover Page**: Operation details and metadata
- **Message Pages**: Chronological transcript with media thumbnails
- **Pagination**: Automatic page breaks for long conversations

### Media Handling

**Photos:**
- Thumbnail in PDF: 100x100px
- Full resolution saved to media folder
- Format preserved (JPEG/PNG)

**Videos:**
- Placeholder in PDF: 100x100px gray box with üìπ icon
- Full video saved to media folder
- Format preserved (MP4/MOV)

## UI Components

### Export Button
- **Location**: Operation Details screen, after "Save as Template"
- **Appearance**: 
  - Green background (opacity 0.1)
  - Green text
  - Icon: `square.and.arrow.up`
  - Full-width button
- **States**:
  - Normal: Tappable
  - Exporting: Disabled with progress indicator
  - Error: Red error message displayed

### Filter View
- **Navigation Title**: "Export Chat"
- **Sections**:
  1. Operation Details (read-only summary)
  2. Time Range (toggle + date pickers)
  3. Members (toggle + checkboxes)
  4. Export Contents (preview information)
- **Validation**: Prevents export if member filter is on but none selected

## Error Handling

### Possible Errors
1. **No messages to export** (with filters applied)
   - User-friendly message: "No messages to export with the selected filters"
   
2. **Media download failure**
   - Continues with other media
   - Logs error but doesn't fail entire export
   
3. **PDF generation failure**
   - Error message displayed in UI
   
4. **No network connection**
   - Standard error handling

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Parallel Media Downloads**
   - Downloads media files sequentially (to avoid memory spikes)
   - Could be optimized to download 3-5 in parallel if needed

2. **Memory Management**
   - Media stored temporarily in-memory during export
   - Cleaned up after export completes
   - PDF written directly to temporary directory

3. **Progress Indication**
   - Shows "Generating export..." during process
   - Could be enhanced with percentage progress

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Button only visible on ended operations
- [ ] Button hidden on active/draft operations
- [ ] Filter view presents correctly
- [ ] Date range pickers work correctly
- [ ] Member selection toggles work
- [ ] Export validation works (member filter)
- [ ] PDF generation succeeds with no media
- [ ] PDF generation succeeds with photos only
- [ ] PDF generation succeeds with videos only
- [ ] PDF generation succeeds with mixed media
- [ ] Media folder contains all files
- [ ] Share sheet presents correctly
- [ ] Save to Files works
- [ ] AirDrop works
- [ ] Email attachment works
- [ ] Export with date filter works
- [ ] Export with member filter works
- [ ] Export with no filters works
- [ ] Long operations (100+ messages) work
- [ ] Operations with no chat messages show error
- [ ] Network error handling works

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Operation with 0 messages
- [ ] Operation with 1 message

- [ ] Messages with only media (no text)
- [ ] Messages with special characters
- [ ] Messages with emojis
- [ ] Very long messages (1000+ characters)
- [ ] Media files that no longer exist in storage
- [ ] Multiple simultaneous exports (race conditions)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Export Format Options**
   - CSV export
   - JSON export
   - HTML export

2. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Search by keyword
   - Filter by media type (photos only, videos only)
   - Filter by time of day

3. **Progress Bar**
   - Show percentage complete
   - Show current step (fetching, downloading, generating)
   - Cancel button

4. **Custom Templates**
   - Agency branding
   - Custom cover page
   - Include operation photos from targets

5. **Scheduled Exports**
   - Auto-export at operation end
   - Email to specified addresses

6. **Export History**
   - Track when exports were generated
   - Re-download previous exports

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- ‚úÖ Only members of the operation can export
- ‚úÖ Must be authenticated
- ‚úÖ RLS policies on `op_messages` table enforced

### Data Privacy
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Exported files stored in device temporary directory
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User responsible for secure handling after export
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No encryption on exported files (future enhancement)

### Recommendations
1. Add disclaimer in filter view about data sensitivity
2. Consider adding watermark with export timestamp and user ID
3. Optional encryption for sensitive operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No messages to export"**
- Check if filters are too restrictive
- Verify operation actually has chat messages

**"Failed to download media"**
- Check network connection
- Verify media still exists in Supabase Storage
- Check Supabase Storage permissions

**"PDF generation failed"**
- Check device storage space
- Try with fewer messages (use date filter)

**Share sheet doesn't appear**
- Check view controller hierarchy
- Verify export completed successfully
- Check console logs for errors

## Code Maintenance

### Key Dependencies
- `PDFKit` (iOS native, no external deps)
- `UIKit` (for share sheet and PDF generation)
- `Supabase` (for database and storage access)

### Configuration
All hardcoded values are in `ChatExportService.swift`:
- Page size: 612 x 792 (US Letter)
- Margins: 50 points
- Thumbnail size: 100x100 points
- Font sizes: 24 (title), 14 (details), 12 (content), 11 (headers)

### Localization
Currently all strings are hardcoded in English. To add localization:
1. Extract all user-facing strings to `Localizable.strings`
2. Update filter view labels
3. Update PDF cover page text
4. Update error messages
