# Operation Details & Creation Workflow Improvements

## üéØ Goal
Improve the operation details page and creation workflow for better UX, clearer information display, and smoother operation management.

---

## üìã Current State Analysis

### **Operation Details Page (`ActiveOperationDetailView`)**
Current features:
- Shows operation name, incident number, state
- Lists targets and staging points as cards
- "Request to Join" for non-members
- Edit operation (swipe action)
- End/Leave/Transfer buttons
- Join request management (case agent only)
- Pull-to-refresh

**Potential Improvements Needed:**
- Better visual hierarchy?
- More intuitive actions?
- Better target/staging presentation?
- Member list visibility?
- Quick actions/shortcuts?

### **Operation Creation Workflow (`CreateOperationView`)**
Current 5-step process:
1. Name & Incident Number
2. Targets (Person/Vehicle/Location)
3. Staging Points
4. Team Members
5. Review & Create

**Potential Improvements Needed:**
- Simplify steps?
- Better validation feedback?
- Skip optional steps?
- Save drafts?
- Better target management?
- Clone/template support?

## üìù Specific Suggestions (Examples)

### **Operation Details Header:**
```swift
// Add a summary card at the top
VStack(spacing: 8) {
    HStack {
        Label(operation.name, systemImage: "briefcase.fill")
            .font(.title2.bold())
        
        Spacer()
        
        // Status badge
        StatusBadge(state: operation.state)
    }
    
    // Quick stats
    HStack(spacing: 16) {
        StatItem(icon: "person.3", value: "\(memberCount)", label: "Members")
        StatItem(icon: "target", value: "\(targetCount)", label: "Targets")
        StatItem(icon: "mappin", value: "\(stagingCount)", label: "Staging")
        StatItem(icon: "clock", value: duration, label: "Duration")
    }
}
.padding()
.background(Color(.secondarySystemGroupedBackground))
.cornerRadius(12)
```

### **Creation Workflow - Optional Steps:**
```swift
// Allow skipping team members if you want to add them later
Button("Skip - Add Later") {
    selectedMemberIds.removeAll()
    currentStep = .review
}
.foregroundColor(.secondary)
```

### **Quick Actions Toolbar:**
```swift
// Floating action button or toolbar
HStack {
    QuickActionButton(icon: "plus", label: "Add Target") { }
    QuickActionButton(icon: "person.badge.plus", label: "Invite") { }
    QuickActionButton(icon: "map", label: "View Map") { }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Ready to Implement

Once you clarify the priorities, I can:
1. Create detailed mockups/code for each improvement
2. Implement them one by one
