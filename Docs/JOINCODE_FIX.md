# Join Code Column Missing - Quick Fix ‚úÖ

## Problem
```
‚ùå Failed to load operations: PostgrestError(...)
message: "column o.join_code does not exist"
```

## Root Cause
Your `operations` table doesn't have a `join_code` column yet. This is optional for MVP.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed join_code from RPC Function ‚úÖ
**File:** `Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql`

The `rpc_get_user_operations()` function no longer queries `join_code`:

```sql
SELECT json_agg(json_build_object(
    'id', o.id,
    'name', o.name,
    'incident_number', o.incident_number,
    -- 'join_code', o.join_code,  ‚Üê REMOVED
    'status', o.status,
    ...
))
```

### 2. Updated Swift Code ‚úÖ
**File:** `Services/SupabaseRPCService.swift`

- Removed `join_code` from Response struct
- Set `joinCode: ""` when creating Operation objects

```swift
let operation = Operation(
    ...
    joinCode: "", // Will be added to DB later
    ...
)
```

## What This Means

For MVP testing:
- ‚úÖ Operations will load correctly
- ‚úÖ Operations will save correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Join codes will be empty strings (not visible in UI)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can't join operations via code yet

## If You Want Join Codes (Optional)

Add the column to your database later:

```sql
-- Add join_code column (run in Supabase SQL Editor)
ALTER TABLE operations
ADD COLUMN join_code TEXT;

-- Optionally make it unique
ALTER TABLE operations
ADD CONSTRAINT operations_join_code_key UNIQUE (join_code);

-- Generate codes for existing operations
UPDATE operations
SET join_code = substring(md5(random()::text) from 1 for 6)
WHERE join_code IS NULL;
```

Then update the RPC function to include it again.

## Action Required Now

1. **Re-run SQL script** in Supabase:
   ```
   Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql
   ```

2. **Rebuild app:**
   ```bash
   # In Xcode:
   Cmd+Shift+K, Cmd+B, Cmd+R
   ```

3. **Test:**
   - Create operation
   - Close app
   - Reopen app
   - ‚úÖ Operations should load without error

## Expected Console Output

```
üîÑ Loading operations for user: [uuid]
üîÑ Loaded 1 operations from database
  ‚úÖ Loaded: Test Operation (draft)
‚úÖ Loaded 1 operations
   ‚Ä¢ Test Operation - draft - created: 2024-10-19 15:45:22
```

No more "column o.join_code does not exist" error! ‚úÖ

## For Future: Join Operation Feature

When ready to implement "Join Operation by Code":
1. Add `join_code` column to database
2. Update `rpc_get_user_operations()` to include it
3. Update Swift Response struct
4. Generate join codes when creating operations
5. Implement join workflow in `JoinOperationView`

For now, users can be added to operations by the case agent.

---

**Status:** Fixed! Operations will now load/save without join codes. üéâ
