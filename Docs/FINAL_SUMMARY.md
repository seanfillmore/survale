## 🐛 Key Bugs Fixed

1. **"Settings button always active"** → Fixed save validation logic
2. **Keyboard lag** → Moved async validation, removed heavy view evaluations
3. **Tab switching lag** → Added data prefetching and caching
4. **Team members not showing** → Fixed RPC function, added proper member loading
5. **Ambiguous column errors** → Fixed SQL queries with explicit table aliases
6. **Template addresses empty** → Added address support throughout stack
7. **Enum casting errors** → Added `::op_status` casts in SQL
8. **Duplicate functions** → Removed with aggressive drop scripts
9. **Keyboard covering button** → Added ScrollView with keyboard dismiss

## ✨ User Experience Improvements

### **Before:**
- Operation details showed minimal info
- No template system
- No draft system  
- Staging points couldn't be edited
- Keyboard blocked important buttons
- Significant UI lag

### **After:**
- Rich operation details with statistics
- Full template system (save, load, share)
- Draft operations support
- Staging points fully editable (matches targets)
- Smooth keyboard interactions
- Fast, responsive UI

## 🚀 Testing Checklist

- [x] Create operation (active)
- [x] Create operation (draft)
- [x] Save operation as template (personal)
- [x] Save operation as template (agency-wide)
- [x] Load template in creation flow
- [x] Edit staging points
- [x] View operation details
- [x] Tap team member to see profile
- [x] Call team member from profile
- [x] View drafts list
- [x] Delete draft
- [x] Keyboard doesn't block buttons

## 📝 Notes

- All template addresses are now saved properly
- Old templates (created before address support) will have empty addresses but work fine
- To fix old templates: Delete and recreate, or manually update in database
- All SQL functions now use `p_` parameter prefixes for consistency
- Enum types require explicit `::op_status` casting in SQL

---

## 🎊 Success!

The operation details improvements and template system are **fully functional**. All major features are working, bugs are fixed, and the user experience is smooth!
