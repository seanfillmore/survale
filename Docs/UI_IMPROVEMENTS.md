# UI Improvements - Target & Staging Creation

## What Changed

### 1. Added Label Field for Location Targets
Location targets now have a **custom label** field separate from the address.

**Before:**
- Label was the full address: "2164 N Goddard Ave, Simi Valley, 93063"
- Showed twice on map (annotation title + pin label)

**After:**
- Custom label field: "Suspect's Home", "Safe House", etc.
- Falls back to address if no custom label provided
- Only shows once on map

### 2. Moved "Add" Buttons to Top
All "Add Target" and "Add Staging Point" buttons now appear **above** the data entry fields.

**Benefits:**
- More intuitive workflow - add button is visible first
- Better for mobile - thumb-friendly position
- Clearer call-to-action

### 3. Button Behavior
- **Person Target**: Enabled when name or photo provided
- **Vehicle Target**: Enabled when any field filled
- **Location Target**: Enabled when address selected AND coordinates captured
- **Staging Point**: Enabled when label, address, AND coordinates provided

## User Experience

### Creating a Location Target:
1. See "Add Target" button at top (disabled)
2. Enter custom label: "Suspect's Home"
3. Type address and tap suggestion
4. City/ZIP auto-fill
5. Button enables when coordinates captured
6. Tap "Add Target"
7. Fields clear for next target

### On Map:
- **Before**: "2164 N Goddard Ave, Simi Valley, 93063" (shows twice, cluttered)
- **After**: "Suspect's Home" (clean, meaningful)

## Examples

### Good Labels:
- "Suspect's Home"
- "Meeting Point"
- "Drop Location"
- "Surveillance Point"
- "Safe House"

### Fallback (if no label):
- "2164 N Goddard Ave, Simi Valley, 93063" (address used)

## Technical Details

**New State Variable:**
```swift
@State private var locationLabel = ""
```

**Label Logic:**
```swift
if !locationLabel.isEmpty {
    label = locationLabel
} else {
    label = addressParts.joined(separator: ", ")
}
```

**Field Order:**
1. Add Button (top)
2. Label field
3. Address search
4. City
5. ZIP
6. Photo picker
7. Notes

## Testing

Rebuild and test:
1. Create operation
2. Add location target with custom label "Test Location"
3. Go to Map
4. RED pin should show "Test Location" (not the full address)
5. Tap pin to verify clean label

All buttons should now be at the top of each section! ðŸŽ‰
