-- ============================================
-- MVP SIMPLE SETUP - No Teams/Agencies Required
-- ============================================
-- This creates a simplified trigger for MVP testing
-- All users get a single default team/agency automatically

-- STEP 1: Create ONE default agency and team for MVP
INSERT INTO agencies (name, created_at)
VALUES ('MVP Agency', NOW())
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

INSERT INTO teams (agency_id, name, created_at)
SELECT 
    a.id,

WHERE a.name = 'MVP Agency'
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

-- Verify they exist
SELECT 'Agency Created:' as status, id, name FROM agencies WHERE name = 'MVP Agency'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Team Created:' as status, id, name FROM teams WHERE name = 'MVP Team';

-- STEP 2: Simple trigger - just adds users to MVP Team
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER

-- STEP 4: Add all existing orphaned users to MVP Team
INSERT INTO users (

)
SELECT 
    au.id,

    'sedan',
    'black',

LEFT JOIN users u ON au.id = u.id

-- STEP 5: Update existing users who might have NULL team/agency
UPDATE users
SET 
    agency_id = (SELECT id FROM agencies WHERE name = 'MVP Agency'),
    team_id = (SELECT id FROM teams WHERE name = 'MVP Team')
WHERE agency_id IS NULL OR team_id IS NULL;

-- STEP 6: Verify everything worked
SELECT 'âœ… SETUP COMPLETE!' as status;
