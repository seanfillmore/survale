## 🎯 **What You'll Notice**

1. **More Information**: See member count, target count, staging count, and duration at a glance
2. **Better Organization**: Clear sections with icons and counts
3. **Member Visibility**: No more wondering who's on the operation
4. **Professional Look**: Gradients, shadows, proper spacing
5. **Vehicle Info**: See what each member is driving (color + type)
6. **Role Indicators**: Case Agent gets a ⭐, you get a "(You)" label

---

## 🚧 **To Test Phase 1**

1. Build and run the app
2. Navigate to any active operation
3. You should see:
   - New statistics header
   - Team members list (if you're a member)
   - Enhanced target/staging cards

4. **If you don't see the new UI**:
   - Make sure you pulled the latest code
   - Rebuild the project
   - Check that you're on `feature/operation-details-improvements` branch

---

## 📝 **Next Steps**

I'll continue working on Phase 2 (draft functionality) automatically. No action needed from you unless you want to:

1. **Test the Phase 1 changes** and provide feedback
2. **Run the SQL script** to enable draft support in the database
3. **Request changes** to the visual design
4. **Skip to Phase 3** (templates) if drafts aren't needed
