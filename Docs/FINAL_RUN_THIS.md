# Final Fix - Run This One Script

## Status
✅ Targets are saving successfully!
⚠️ Just need to fix the fetch function

## Action Required

**Run `Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql` one more time** in Supabase SQL Editor

This updates the `rpc_get_operation_targets` function to not require `created_at` from staging_areas.

## Then Test

1. Rebuild app (just in case, but probably not needed)
2. Go to Map tab
3. You should see pins!

Expected console output:
```
🔄 Loading targets for operation: [uuid]
🔍 RPC Response: 3 targets, 1 staging
   📍 Staging from DB: HOJ at (lat, lon)
✅ Converted 1 staging points
📍 Loaded 3 targets and 1 staging points
   Staging: HOJ at (lat, lon)
Showing 4 pin(s) on map
```

## What You'll See on Map

- 🔴 **RED pins** for person/vehicle/location targets
- 🟢 **GREEN pin** for staging point
- 🚗 **Blue vehicle markers** for team members

## Verify Data

```sql
-- Check targets (should show all 3)
SELECT 
    id,
    type,
    data->>'first_name' as name,
    data->>'make' as vehicle_make,
    data->>'address' as location
FROM targets
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check staging (should show 1)
SELECT name, lat, lon FROM staging_areas;
```

## You're Almost There! 🎉

Once this works, you have a fully functional MVP:
- ✅ Create operations
- ✅ Add targets (person/vehicle/location)
- ✅ Add staging points
- ✅ View on map
- ✅ Share with team
- ✅ Real-time location tracking

Ready for your 8-10 user test group!
