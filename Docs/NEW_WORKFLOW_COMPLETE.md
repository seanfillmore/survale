# New Operation Workflow - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## What Was Implemented

### ‚úÖ 1. Removed Join Codes
- Removed `joinCode` from `Operation` model
- Removed `join_code` column from database queries
- Deleted `JoinOperationView.swift`
- Operations now default to `active` state on creation

### ‚úÖ 2. All Active Operations View
- `OperationsView` now shows **all** active operations
- New RPC function: `rpc_get_all_active_operations()`
- Includes `is_member` flag to show which operations user is in

### ‚úÖ 3. Request to Join
- Users can request to join operations they're not in
- New RPC function: `rpc_request_join_operation(operation_id UUID)`
- UI shows "Request" button for operations user isn't in
- Shows "Requested" badge after request is sent
- **Note**: Join request approval/notification system is TODO for later

### ‚úÖ 4. Five-Step Operation Creation
Reordered workflow: **Basic Info ‚Üí Targets ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Team Members ‚Üí Review**

#### Step 1: Basic Info
- Incident / Case Number (optional)
- Operation Name

#### Step 2: Targets
- Add Person, Vehicle, or Location targets
- Address autocomplete with coordinates

#### Step 3: Staging Points
- Add staging locations
- Address autocomplete with coordinates

#### Step 4: Team Members (NEW)
- Multi-select team roster
- Members already in operations are grayed out
- Shows "In Operation" badge for unavailable members
- Optional - can create operation without adding members

#### Step 5: Review
- Summary of all details
- Shows count of selected team members

### ‚úÖ 5. One Active Operation Constraint
- **Enforced at database level** in `rpc_add_operation_members()`
- When adding user to new operation, automatically removes them from previous operation
- Sets `left_at = NOW()` on old membership

### ‚úÖ 6. Team Management RPC Functions

#### `rpc_get_team_roster()`
Returns all users in current user's team with status:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "full_name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "badge_number": "12345",
  "in_operation": true,
  "operation_id": "uuid or null"
}
```

#### `rpc_add_operation_members(operation_id, member_user_ids[])`
- Adds multiple members to an operation
- Enforces "one active operation" constraint
- Returns count of added members
- Only case agent can add members

### ‚úÖ 7. Enhanced UI
- **Current Operation Banner**: Shows at top of operations list
- **Member Badge**: Shows "Member" for operations user is in
- **Active Badge**: Shows "Active" for user's current operation
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Swipe down to reload operations list
- **5-step Progress Bar**: Shows "1 of 5", "2 of 5", etc.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Run SQL Script
Run the updated SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor:

**File**: `Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql`

This script now includes:
- All previous RPC functions (create operation, targets, staging, etc.)
- **NEW** `rpc_get_team_roster()`
- **NEW** `rpc_add_operation_members(operation_id, member_user_ids[])`
- **UPDATED** `rpc_get_all_active_operations()` (includes `is_member` flag)
- **NEW** `rpc_request_join_operation(operation_id)`

### Step 2: Test the Workflow

1. **Create Operation**:
   - Tap "+" in Operations tab
   - Fill in incident number and name
   - Add targets and staging points
   - **NEW**: Select team members to add
   - Review and create

2. **View All Operations**:
   - See all active operations (not just yours)
   - Your active operation shows at top
   - "Member" badge shows operations you're in
   - "Active" badge shows your current operation

3. **Request to Join**:
   - Tap "Request" on any operation you're not in
   - Confirm the request
   - Badge changes to "Requested"

4. **Pull to Refresh**:
   - Swipe down on operations list
   - Refreshes all active operations

## üìä Database Changes

### New RPC Functions (8 & 9)
```sql
-- 8. ADD MULTIPLE MEMBERS TO OPERATION
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.rpc_add_operation_members(
    operation_id UUID,
    member_user_ids UUID[]
)
-- Enforces "one active operation" constraint
-- Removes users from previous operations automatically

-- 9. GET TEAM ROSTER
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.rpc_get_team_roster()
-- Returns all team members with operation status
```

### Updated RPC Functions
```sql
-- rpc_get_all_active_operations()
-- Now includes "is_member" boolean flag

-- rpc_create_operation()
-- Now creates operations as "active" by default
```

---

## üéØ What Works Now

‚úÖ Create operations with 5-step workflow  
‚úÖ Add team members during creation  
‚úÖ See all active operations  
‚úÖ Know which operations you're in  
‚úÖ Request to join other operations  
‚úÖ Pull-to-refresh operations list  
‚úÖ One active operation per user (enforced)  
‚úÖ Members auto-removed from old operation when added to new one  
‚úÖ Visual indicators for current operation  

---

## üìù What's Left for Later (Not MVP)

‚ùå **Join Request Approval System**:
- Case agent receives notification
- Case agent can approve/deny requests
- Requester gets notified of decision
- **For MVP**: Manually add members via SQL or let case agent add during creation

‚ùå **Push Notifications**:
- When added to operation
- When join request is approved/denied
- **For MVP**: Using Realtime (live updates when app is open)

‚ùå **Operation Analytics**:
- View operation history
- See who was in past operations
- Duration, targets count, etc.

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run `Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] Create new operation with all 5 steps
- [ ] Add team members in step 4
- [ ] Verify members are added (check DB or reload app)
- [ ] View operations list - see "Your Active Operation" banner
- [ ] Create second operation - verify first one auto-ends membership
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh operations list
- [ ] Request to join another operation
- [ ] Verify "Requested" badge appears

**Swift Code**:
- `Views/CreateOperationView.swift` - 5-step workflow + team member selector
- `Views/OperationsView.swift` - All operations view + pull-to-refresh
- `Services/SupabaseRPCService.swift` - New RPC functions
- `Operation.swift` - Removed `joinCode`

**SQL**:
- `Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql` - **RUN THIS** (includes all functions)
- `Docs/clear_operations_safe.sql` - Clear test data if needed

**Removed**:
- `Views/JoinOperationView.swift` - ‚ùå Deleted (no longer needed)

## üí° Notes

1. **"One Active Operation" is enforced at database level**, not app level. Users are automatically removed from their previous operation when added to a new one.

2. **Case agents can add members anytime** (not just during creation). The `rpc_add_operation_members()` function can be called anytime by the case agent.

3. **Join requests are stored but not processed yet**. For MVP, case agents should add members directly during operation creation.

4. **The SQL script is cumulative** - running `simple_target_rpc.sql` creates/updates ALL RPC functions, not just the new ones.
