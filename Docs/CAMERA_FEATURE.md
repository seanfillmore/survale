## 🔧 Technical Details

### Camera Permissions:
```swift
// Check permission status
CameraPermissionHelper.checkCameraPermission()

// Request permission
await CameraPermissionHelper.requestCameraPermission()

// Check availability
CameraPermissionHelper.isCameraAvailable
```

### Media Types Supported:
- **Images**: JPEG format, 80% quality
- **Videos**: MP4 format, medium quality, max 60 seconds

### Storage Path:
```
chat-media/
  └── {operation-uuid}/
      ├── {uuid}.jpg  (photos)
      └── {uuid}.mp4  (videos)
```

### File Size Considerations:
- **Photos**: ~200KB - 2MB (compressed JPEG)
- **Videos**: ~2-10MB per minute (medium quality)
- **Max video**: 60 seconds (~5-10MB)

## 🎯 Device Compatibility

### Camera Available:
- ✅ iPhone (all models with camera)
- ✅ iPad (with rear/front cameras)
- ❌ Simulator (shows library option only)
- ❌ Mac Catalyst (shows library option only)

### Graceful Degradation:
If camera is not available:
- Action sheet only shows "Photo/Video Library" option
- Feature still works for selecting from library
- No camera-specific UI shown

## 🔒 Privacy & Permissions

### First Launch:
1. User taps "+" button
2. Selects "Take Photo"
3. iOS shows camera permission alert
4. User must approve to use camera
5. If denied, shows library option only

### Permission Strings (Info.plist):
- **Camera**: "Survale needs access to your camera to take photos and videos for sharing with your team during operations."
- **Microphone**: "Survale needs access to your microphone to record audio when capturing videos during operations."
- **Photo Library**: "Survale needs permission to save photos and videos to your library."

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Camera not opening:
- ✅ Check device has a camera (not simulator)
- ✅ Verify Info.plist has NSCameraUsageDescription
- ✅ Check camera permission in iOS Settings
- ✅ Restart app after permission changes

### Video recording issues:
- ✅ Ensure microphone permission granted
- ✅ Check available storage space
- ✅ Videos limited to 60 seconds by default
- ✅ Medium quality to balance size/quality

### Upload failures:
- ✅ Check network connection
- ✅ Verify Supabase storage bucket exists
- ✅ Check storage policies allow uploads
- ✅ Review console logs for specific errors

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Video Settings (in CameraView.swift):
```swift
picker.videoQuality = .typeMedium  // Change to .typeHigh or .typeLow
picker.videoMaximumDuration = 60   // Change max duration (seconds)
```

### Image Compression (in handleCameraCapture):
```swift
image.jpegData(compressionQuality: 0.8)  // 0.0 - 1.0 (0.8 = good balance)
```

### Action Sheet Title:
```swift
.confirmationDialog("Add Media", ...)  // Change title text
```
