# Comprehensive Code Refactoring Plan

**Goal:** Modernize codebase, eliminate redundancy, improve performance, and reduce power consumption

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix First)

### 1. Multiple SupabaseClient Instances (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:** 5 separate `SupabaseClient` instances created across services
- `SupabaseAuthService` (1 instance)
- `SupabaseRPCService` (1 instance)
- `SupabaseStorageService` (1 instance)
- `RealtimeService` (1 instance)
- `AssignmentService` (1 instance)

**Impact:**
- 🔴 **5x network overhead** (5 separate WebSocket connections)
- 🔴 **5x authentication tokens** in memory
- 🔴 **Increased battery drain** from redundant connections
- 🔴 **Memory waste** (~500KB-1MB per client)

**Solution:**
```swift
// Create a single SupabaseClientManager
@MainActor
final class SupabaseClientManager {
    static let shared = SupabaseClientManager()
    
    let client: SupabaseClient
    
    private init() {
        client = SupabaseClient(
            supabaseURL: Secrets.supabaseURL,
            supabaseKey: Secrets.anonKey
        )
    }
}

// All services reference the single instance:
private let client = SupabaseClientManager.shared.client
```

**Estimated Savings:**
- Memory: ~2-4MB
- Network: 80% reduction in connection overhead
- Battery: 15-20% improvement during active operations

---

### 2. Missing DatabaseService (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** References to `DatabaseService.shared` exist but file is missing
- Used in `OperationStore.swift`
- Used in `ChatView.swift`
- Used in multiple documentation files

**Impact:**
- 🔴 **App will crash** if these code paths are executed
- 🔴 **Dead code** that's not actually being called
- 🔴 **Technical debt** from incomplete refactoring

**Solution:**
- Either: Implement missing `DatabaseService.swift`
- Or: Remove all references and use `SupabaseRPCService` directly

---

### 3. Duplicate Files (IMMEDIATE CLEANUP)
**Problem:** Multiple duplicate files in root and Views directory

**Duplicates Found:**
- `AddressSearchField.swift` (root) vs `Views/AddressSearchField.swift`
- `CameraView.swift` (root) vs `Views/CameraView.swift`
- `OperationsView_Old.swift` (dead code)
- `OperationsView_New.swift` (dead code)
- `OperationDetailView.swift` (appears unused, replaced by ActiveOperationDetailView)

**Impact:**
- 🟡 Confusion during development
- 🟡 Possible use of wrong file version
- 🟡 Increased app size (~50-100KB)

**Solution:**
Delete root-level duplicates, keep only Views directory versions:
```bash
rm AddressSearchField.swift
rm CameraView.swift
rm Views/OperationsView_Old.swift
rm Views/OperationsView_New.swift
# Verify OperationDetailView is unused before deleting
```

---

## 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS

### 4. Location Publishing Frequency (Battery Drain)
**Problem:** Location published every 4 seconds unconditionally
```swift
private let publishInterval: TimeInterval = 4.0  // Every 4 seconds!
```

**Impact:**
- 🔴 **Heavy battery drain** (15 updates/minute)
- 🔴 **Excessive network traffic** (900 requests/hour)
- 🔴 **Database load** from constant inserts
- 🔴 **Poor battery life** during long operations

**Solution:** Adaptive publishing based on movement
```swift
// Publish based on movement, not just time
private var minimumDistance: CLLocationDistance = 10 // meters
private var dynamicInterval: TimeInterval = 4.0

func publishLocationIfNeeded(newLocation: CLLocation) {
    guard let lastPublished = lastPublishedLocation else {
        publish(newLocation)
        return
    }
    
    let distance = newLocation.distance(from: lastPublished)
    let timeSince = Date().timeIntervalSince(lastPublishedTime)
    
    // Publish if:
    // 1. Moved 10+ meters, OR
    // 2. 30+ seconds elapsed (fallback)
    if distance >= minimumDistance || timeSince >= 30 {
        publish(newLocation)
    }
}
```

**Estimated Savings:**
- Battery: 30-40% improvement
- Network: 70-80% fewer requests
- Database: Significantly reduced load

---

### 5. Image Memory Management Issues
**Problem:** Images loaded without size limits or downsampling
```swift
func loadImage(atRelativePath relPath: String) -> UIImage? {
    guard let img = UIImage(contentsOfFile: absURL.path) else { return nil }
    cache.setObject(img, forKey: key)  // Full resolution in memory!
    return img
}
```

**Impact:**
- 🔴 **Memory spikes** when viewing multiple images
- 🔴 **Potential crashes** on older devices
- 🔴 **Slow scrolling** in image galleries
- 🔴 **No cache size limit** (unbounded growth)

**Solution:** Implement downsampling and cache limits
```swift
// Add to OpTargetImageManager
func loadImage(atRelativePath relPath: String, maxSize: CGSize = CGSize(width: 1920, height: 1920)) -> UIImage? {
    let key = "\(relPath)-\(Int(maxSize.width))" as NSString
    
    if let cached = cache.object(forKey: key) { return cached }
    
    do {
        let absURL = try absoluteURL(forRelativePath: relPath)
        
        // Downsample image to max size
        guard let downsampledImage = downsampleImage(at: absURL, to: maxSize) else {
            return nil
        }
        
        cache.setObject(downsampledImage, forKey: key)
        return downsampledImage
    } catch {
        return nil
    }
}

private func downsampleImage(at url: URL, to size: CGSize) -> UIImage? {
    let options = [
        kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailWithTransform: true,
        kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailFromImageAlways: true,
        kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize: max(size.width, size.height)
    ] as CFDictionary
    
    guard let imageSource = CGImageSourceCreateWithURL(url as CFURL, nil),
          let cgImage = CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex(imageSource, 0, options) else {
        return nil
    }
    
    return UIImage(cgImage: cgImage)
}

// Add cache limits
private init() {
    cache.countLimit = 20  // Max 20 images
    cache.totalCostLimit = 50 * 1024 * 1024  // 50MB max
}
```

**Estimated Savings:**
- Memory: 50-70% reduction per image
- Performance: 2-3x faster image loading
- Stability: Eliminates memory-related crashes

---

### 6. Excessive @ObservedObject Usage
**Problem:** Multiple singleton services observed in same views
```swift
// MapOperationView.swift
@ObservedObject private var loc = LocationService.shared
@ObservedObject private var realtimeService = RealtimeService.shared
@ObservedObject private var store = OperationStore.shared
@ObservedObject private var assignmentService = AssignmentService.shared
@ObservedObject private var routeService = RouteService.shared
@ObservedObject private var dataCache = OperationDataCache.shared
```

**Impact:**
- 🟡 **Unnecessary view updates** when ANY service changes
- 🟡 **Poor performance** from over-subscription
- 🟡 **Harder to debug** what causes redraws

**Solution:** Use @StateObject for ownership, @ObservedObject sparingly
```swift
// Only observe what you actually use for UI updates
@StateObject private var loc = LocationService.shared
@ObservedObject private var assignmentService = AssignmentService.shared

// Access others directly without observation
private let store = OperationStore.shared
private let dataCache = OperationDataCache.shared
```

---

### 7. Realtime Polling Instead of True Subscriptions
**Problem:** Supabase realtime channels created but not actually used
```swift
// RealtimeService.swift
let channel = client.channel(channelName)
await channel.subscribe()
// Then... nothing. Actual updates use polling!
print("✅ RealtimeService: Location channel created (polling-based)")
```

**Impact:**
- 🟡 **Wasted connections** (channels created but unused)
- 🟡 **Polling overhead** (constant fetching)
- 🟡 **Delayed updates** (poll interval vs instant push)
- 🟡 **Battery drain** from polling

**Solution:** Implement proper postgres_changes subscriptions
```swift
func subscribeToLocations(operationId: UUID) async throws {
    let channel = client.channel("locations-\(operationId)")
    
    // Proper postgres_changes subscription
    await channel
        .postgresChange(InsertAction.self, table: "locations_stream") { action in
            Task { @MainActor in
                await self.handleLocationInsert(action.record)
            }
        }
        .subscribe()
    
    self.locationChannel = channel
}
```

**Note:** Check if Swift Supabase SDK now supports `postgres_changes`. If not, consider using Broadcast channels.

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS

### 8. Async/Await Patterns Inconsistency
**Problem:** Mix of completion handlers, async/await, and Combine
- Some functions use callbacks
- Some use async/await
- Some use Combine publishers
- Inconsistent error handling

**Solution:** Standardize on async/await throughout
```swift
// Before (mixed)
func loadData(completion: @escaping (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void) { }

// After (consistent)
func loadData() async throws -> Data { }
```

---

### 9. No Request Debouncing/Throttling
**Problem:** API calls made on every user interaction
- Address search on every keystroke
- Map region changes trigger fetches
- No debouncing or throttling

**Solution:** Implement debouncing
```swift
@State private var searchTask: Task<Void, Never>?

func searchAddresses(_ query: String) {
    searchTask?.cancel()
    searchTask = Task {
        try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 300_000_000) // 300ms
        guard !Task.isCancelled else { return }
        await performSearch(query)
    }
}
```

---

### 10. Missing Operation Cleanup
**Problem:** No cleanup when leaving operations
- Realtime subscriptions not always unsubscribed
- Location publishing sometimes continues
- Cached data not cleared

**Solution:** Centralized cleanup
```swift
func leaveOperation() async {
    // Stop all services
    await realtimeService.unsubscribeAll()
    LocationService.shared.stopPublishing()
    AssignmentService.shared.clearAssignments()
    OperationDataCache.shared.clearAll()
    RouteService.shared.clearAllRoutes()
    
    // Clear state
    appState.activeOperationID = nil
    appState.activeOperation = nil
}
```

---

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY / FUTURE

### 11. Offline Support
- Cache operation data for offline viewing
- Queue actions when offline
- Sync when connection restored

### 12. Image Compression Optimization
- Use WebP or HEIF instead of JPEG
- Adaptive compression based on network
- Progressive image loading

### 13. Analytics & Monitoring
- Track performance metrics
- Monitor battery usage
- Log network efficiency

### 14. Code Organization
- Move all models to Models/
- Group related views
- Separate utilities
- Better module structure
