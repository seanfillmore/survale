# Performance Bugfix Summary

**Branch:** `bugfix/settings-button-always-active`  
**Status:** ✅ Ready to Merge  
**Impact:** Critical UX improvement - eliminates 5-7 second delays

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Settings Button Always Active (Original Bug)
**Problem:** Update Profile button was enabled even when no changes were made  
**Fix:** Added state tracking for original values and change detection

### 2. Login Screen 5-7 Second Lag (Critical)
**Problem:**
- Email field took 5 seconds to register tap
- Keyboard took 1-2 additional seconds to appear
- Console errors: "keyboard not present", "timeout exceeded"

**Root Cause:** `.fullScreenCover` was nested inside `VStack`, forcing SwiftUI to evaluate the entire `SignUpView` (heavy view with many fields) on every render

**Fix:** Moved `.fullScreenCover` and `.sheet` modifiers outside `VStack` to parent view level

### 3. Settings Field Navigation Lag
**Problem:** Significant lag when moving between text fields, especially after first interaction

**Root Cause:** `canSave` computed property was running expensive regex validation (`isValidPhoneNumber`) on **every keystroke across all fields**, blocking the main thread

**Fix:**
- Added cached `@State var isPhoneValid` flag
- Moved validation to async `.onChange` handler
- Added `.autocorrectionDisabled()` to all text fields
- Auto-capitalize call sign to UPPERCASE
- Reduced unnecessary phone formatter updates
