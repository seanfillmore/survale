# Operation Editing & Management - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ 1. End Operation (Case Agent Only)
**Feature**: Swipe left on active operation banner to end it

**UI**:
- Swipe left on "Your Active Operation" banner
- Red "End" button with stop icon appears
- Confirmation alert: "Are you sure you want to end this operation?"
- On confirm: Operation status set to 'ended', all members removed

**Implementation**:
- `Views/OperationsView.swift` - Added `.swipeActions()` modifier
- Only visible if `appState.isCurrentUserCaseAgent` is true
- Calls `store.endOperation()` which uses existing `rpc_end_operation()`
- Clears `activeOperationID` and `activeOperation` from AppState
- Reloads operations to show in "Previous Operations"

---

### ✅ 2. Edit Operation (All Members)
**Feature**: Tap on active operation to edit details

**UI**:
- Tap anywhere on "Your Active Operation" banner
- Opens `EditOperationView` - same 5-step workflow as create
- Pre-fills all existing data:
  - Step 1: Operation name, incident number
  - Step 2: Targets (loaded from database)
  - Step 3: Staging points (loaded from database)
  - Step 4: Team members (can add/remove)
  - Step 5: Review changes
- "Save Changes" button at the end

**Implementation**:
- `Views/EditOperationView.swift` - New file
- Loads operation data from database on appear
- Uses new `rpc_update_operation()` to save changes
- All members can edit (not just case agent)
- Reloads operations list when dismissed

---

### ✅ 3. Target/Staging Editing
**How It Works**:
- **Add New**: Fill in fields → Add Target/Staging button
- **Edit Existing**: Tap on target in list → Fields populate → Edit → Update button
- **Delete**: Swipe left on target → Delete

**Note**: For MVP, the edit functionality is built into the same editors used for creation. Full update/delete RPC functions can be added later if needed.

---

### ✅ 4. Previous Operations Section
**Feature**: View history of ended operations

**UI**:
- New section: "Previous Operations" below "Active Operations"
- Shows all operations where user was a member that have ended
- Displays:
  - Operation name
  - Incident / Case Number
  - End date/time
- Tap to view details (read-only)

**Implementation**:
- `OperationStore.previousOperations` - New published property
- `rpc_get_previous_operations()` - New RPC function
- Loads automatically with active operations
- Sorted by end date (most recent first)

---

### ✅ 5. Operation Detail View (Read-Only)
**Feature**: View details of ended operations

**UI**:
- `OperationDetailView` - New file
- Header:
  - Operation name
  - Incident / Case Number
  - Started/Ended timestamps
- Targets section with details:
  - Person: Name, Phone
  - Vehicle: Make, Model, Color, Plate
  - Location: Address, Coordinates
- Staging points section:
  - Label, Address, Coordinates
- Read-only (no editing)

**Implementation**:
- Loads targets/staging from database
- Clean card-based layout
- Accessible from "Previous Operations" list

---

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### New RPC Functions

#### `rpc_update_operation(operation_id, name, incident_number)`
- Allows any member to update operation details
- Checks membership before allowing update
- Updates `operations` table

#### `rpc_get_previous_operations()`
- Returns ended operations where user was a member
- Includes full operation details
- Sorted by end date descending

**File**: `Docs/simple_target_rpc.sql` (functions 10 & 11)

| Title | "Create Operation" | "Edit Operation" |
| Icon | Target symbol | Pencil symbol |
| Data | Empty fields | Pre-filled from DB |
| Button | "Create Operation" | "Save Changes" |
| Targets | Start empty | Loaded from DB |
| Staging | Start empty | Loaded from DB |
| Team Members | Optional | Can add/remove |

## 🔒 Permissions

| Action | Who Can Do It | Where |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Ended operations are read-only** - Cannot be edited or re-opened
2. **Only active operations can be edited** - Banner only shows for active ops

4. **Previous operations persist** - History is preserved even after ending
5. **Case agent is still a member** - They can edit like any other member
